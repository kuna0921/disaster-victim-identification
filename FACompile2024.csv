Madrid-Barcelona, km 3,6. 28850 Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, 28049, Spain","In the town of Calera y Chozas (Spain), five mass graves containing the remains of 28 individuals were discovered during a 2012 excavation. The witnesses and historical evidence indicated that the body of the last Republican mayor of the town, Felipe Fernández Varela, who had died in September 1939, was located in the mass grave designated as no. 1. Within this particular grave, only two bodies were found. Anthropological analysis showed that the first individual was significantly younger than 50 years, being the mayor?s age at the time of death, while the age of the second individual was closer to 50. This second individual had a fractured skull, with a depression on the left parietal bone, and there were unmistakable signs of autopsy, which consisted of cut marks on the frontal bone and the sternal extremity of the right clavicle. Further historical research revealed documents concerning the autopsy performed on this individual. Although, according to the report, the cause of death was a stroke ? the consequence of atherosclerosis and alcoholism ? no reference was made to the forceful impact to the skull or intracranial bleeding. Considering the size of the fracture on the skull and the fact that there were no signs of bone healing, we believe that this impact, and not the stroke, was the direct cause of the death of the last Republican mayor. The mayor?s case is a clear example of the role forensic medicine performed at the beginning of Franco?s dictatorship. The task was not only to conceal the crime but also to tarnish the victim?s name. © 2022, The Author(s).",Autopsy; Exhumation; Head injuries; Identification; Mass grave; Physical anthropology; Spanish Civil War,Autopsy; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Skull; Spain; Stroke; autopsy; case report; cerebrovascular accident; forensic medicine; human; skull; Spain,,,,,,,"Preston P., El holocausto español: odio y exterminio en la Guerra Civil y después, (2011); Espinosa F., Julio de 1936: Golpe militar y plan de exterminio, Morir, matar, sobrevivir: La violencia en la dictadura de Franco, pp. 51-119, (2002); Etxeberria F., Sole Q., Fosas comunes de la Guerra Civil en el Siglo XXI: antecedentes, interdisciplinariedad y legislación, Historia Contemporánea, 2, 60, pp. 401-438, (2019); Walker P.L., Johnson J.R., Lambert P.M., Age and sex biases in the preservation of human skeletal remains, Am J Phys Anthropol, 76, 2, pp. 183-188, (1988); Safont S., Malgosa A., Subira M.E., Sex assessment on the basis of long bone circumference, Am J Phys Anthropol, 113, 3, pp. 317-328, (2000); Ferembach D., Schwidetzky I., Stloukal M., Recommendations for age and sex diagnoses of skeletons, Bull Et Memoires De La Societe D Anthropologie De Paris, 6, 1, pp. 7-45, (1979); Bruzek J., A method for visual determination of sex, using the human hip bone, Am J Phys Anthropol, 117, 2, pp. 157-168, (2002); Herrmann B., Grupe G., Hummel S., Piepenbrink H., Schutkowski H., Prähistorische Anthropologie: Leitfaden der Feldund Labormethoden, (1990); Acsadi G., Nemeskeri J., History of human life span and mortality, (1970); Buikstra J.E., Ubelaker D.H., Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains, (1994); Cuijpers H., Cuijpers A.E., Schutkowsky H., Histological age determination in cremated remains, Helinium, 33, pp. 99-107, (1993); Loth S.R., Henneberg M., Mandibular ramus flexure: a new morphologic indicator of sexual dimorphism in the human skeleton, Am J Phys Anthropol, 99, 3, pp. 473-485, (1996); Brooks S., Suchey J.M., Skeletal age determination based on the os pubis: a comparison of the Acsádi-Nemeskéri and Suchey-Brooks methods, Hum Evol, 5, 3, pp. 227-238, (1990); Lovejoy C.O., Meindl R.S., Pryzbeck T.R., Mensforth R.P., Chronological metamorphosis of the auricular surface of the ilium: a new method for the determination of adult skeletal age at death, Am J Phys Anthropol, 68, 1, pp. 15-28, (1985); Iscan M.Y., Loth S.R., Determination of age from the sternal rib in white females: a test of the phase method, Journal of Forensic Science, 31, 3, pp. 990-999, (1986); Miles A.E.W., Assessment of the ages of a population of Anglo-Saxons from their dentition, Proc R Soc Med, 55, pp. 881-886, (1962); Brothwell D.R., Digging up bones: The excavation, treatment, and study of human skeletal remains, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, (1981); Pearson K., Mathematical contributions to the theory of evolution.

Although a lot is written about the lacunae in disaster preparedness, lessons learnt, and public health concerns after the aftermath, nothing much has been written about the fate of the deceased. Although saving takes priority after a disaster, the management of dead bodies also requires immediate attention because the process of identification becomes more difficult and expensive as time passes. This article shares the firsthand experiences of forensic experts at ground zero during the quake that may be useful to forensic experts responsible for handling such situations worldwide.

The interrelated discipline of physical anthropology addresses questions related to skeletal remains while acknowledging taphonomic parameters. The benefit of integrating these disciplines in forensic investigations has gained increasing acknowledgement over the last decades, but the use of forensic archaeology and anthropology (FAA) remains limited in Sweden. The aim of this study is to analyze the field of FAA in Sweden in relation to outdoor and fire crime scenes where human remains are encountered. Based on qualitative interviews, the state and potential developments of FAA within the Swedish police and the National Board of Forensic Medicine are discussed. The results show that for ensic investigations and analysis of human fragmentary remains are not standardized in Sweden. A great responsibility is placed on the individual crime scene investigator who elects how to investigate these sites and who to contract for the analysis of osteological remains. This can endanger evidence collection and interpretation. This study shows that investigations of buried or fragmentary human remains in Sweden could be aided by a development of FAA. Key steps to further development of FAA within Swedish police involve 1) quantifying cases that could benefit from FAA, 2) establish FAA as an independent subject, 3) develop a national infrastructure, 4) offer professional education in the subject(s), and 4) develop best practice to advance evidence collection and legal security in investigations involving fragmentary human remains. An ongoing ISO accreditation of outdoor crime scene investigations within the Swedish police will hopefully benefit FAA development and collaborations with external partners. © 2021 The Authors",Clandestine burials; Crime scene investigation; Forensic anthropology; Forensic archaeology; Human remains; Swedish police,accreditation; archeology; article; burial; criminalistics; forensic anthropology; forensic medicine; human; human experiment; interview; law enforcement; police; responsibility; security; Sweden; vocational education,,,,,"Bohuslans museum; Knowledge Foundation; Federal Aviation Administration, FAA","Funding text 1: The author would like to thank the interviewees for participating and for sharing their valuable knowledge, Brittany McClain and Megan Veltri for language revision, Anders Högberg and Anna Kjellström for input on previous versions of this manuscript, and Urban Johansson, Jesper Olsson and Eva Segerstedt for information regarding the police organizational structure. Lastly, I am grateful to the editor and the reviewers for valuable comments that helped improve this paper. This resaerch was funded by the Knowledge Foundation and Bohuslans museum , Sweden.; Funding text 2: AFFA was not recognized as an official organization within the Stockholm CSI division, but was run as an interest group (I5, I6). AFFA CSIs did receive some funding from the police to develop FAA. They worked on cases with a FAA profile when possible, spread awareness of FAA applications in CSI, and attended and initiated FAA training (I5, I6). AFFA members attended two archaeological excavations, a ground penetrating radar (GPR) workshop, and organized a seminar [25] . Followingly, the ?AFFA report? was written at the conclusion of the project. AFFA members presented this work at criminological conferences and workshops, as well as gave lectures to other police employees (I5, I6, I10).

From a critical social psychology perspective, we investigate the ways in which these professionals manage their emotions in the face of situations of violence, including murder, massacres, and enforced disappearances. We analyze both the emotional impact of confronting mass violence and the coping mechanisms developed by these professionals in order to continue doing their work. The experiences recounted by the forensic anthropologists interviewed for this study oscillate between a marked professional commitment and the need for distance to safeguard their own emotional well-being. © 2022 The Author(s).

The development and current practice of forensic archaeology is outlined, demonstrating that the discipline has been successfully incorporated into crime- and disaster-scene work in other countries as well as the international humanitarian arena. Despite the application of ostensibly archaeological techniques to clandestine graves by Police and ESR forensic scientists, currently forensic archaeology is absent in New Zealand. Factors including low homicide rates, the absence of suitably qualified forensic archaeologists, a lack of education around what forensic archaeology is, and economic constraints are considered as possible explanations. International evidence shows that any case that requires physical spadework for the recovery of evidence is a case where archaeology can contribute positively, and the low frequency of such situations need not undermine the importance of maximising evidential recovery and interpretation and employing best practice. It is argued that the framework already exists for archaeological approaches to forensic casework in New Zealand, but has only to be integrated with greater training, cooperation and education. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",clandestine graves; forensic anthropology; forensic archaeology; New Zealand forensic archaeology,anthropology; archeology; crime; forensic archeology; forensic identification; homicide; human; law enforcement; medical practice; New Zealand; physical anthropology; police; practice guideline; review; scientist; skeleton,,,,,,,"Lane K., Methodological Proposals for Documenting and Searching for Missing Persons [Internet], pp. 31-41, (2010); Connor M.A., Forensic Methods: Excavation for the Archaeologist and Investigator, (2007); Cox M., Hunter J., Forensic Archaeology: Advances in Theory and Practice, (2005); Haglund W.D., Archaeology and forensic death investigations, Hist Archaeol., 35, 1, pp. 26-34, (2001); Sigler-Eisenberg B., Forensic research: Expanding the concept of applied archaeology, Am Antiquity, 50, 3, pp. 650-655, (1985); Crist T.A.J., Bad to the bone?: Historical archaeologists in the practice of forensic science, Hist Archaeol., 35, 1, pp. 39-56, (2001); Blau S., Forensic archaeology in Australia: Current situations, future possibilities, Aust Archaeol., 58, pp. 11-14, (2004); Hunter J.R., Forensic archaeology in Britain, Antiquity., 68, pp. 758-769, (1994); Morse D., Crusoe D., Smith H.G., Forensic archaeology, J Forensic Sci., 21, 2, pp. 323-332, (1976); Morse D., Duncan J., Stoutamire J., Handbook of Forensic Archaeology and Anthropology, (1983); Skinner M., Lazenby R., Found!

One hundred and twenty four, still unidentified terrorism inmates, were killed after surrendering to the Peruvian Army once it took control of the San Pedro-Lurigancho prison in Lima, Peru in 1986. Two questions are put forward: first, to what extent mechanism of injury (gunshot, blunt, sharp force) and bodily distribution of those injuries allow us to classify individuals into discrete sub-groups of people? The second question is to what respect can such a classification become an additional line of evidence assisting in generating hypotheses of identity regarding those individuals? The analysis of the 109 recovered bodies and their associated evidence show a sub group of four individuals differentiated from the rest based on the combination of injuries (gunshot and blunt force trauma), opposing trajectories and weapons. While the results do not constitute per se proof of identity, they suggest that such a small group of people could have been singled out from the crowd and treated differently. Such information constitutes an additional line of evidence to formulate hypotheses of identity for certain individuals that could have been ring leaders/cadres of the Shining Path, a Maoist movement that started the Internal Armed Conflict (1980 to 2000) in Peru. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Adult; Body Remains; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Male; Multiple Trauma; Peru; Prisoners; Wounds, Gunshot; Wounds, Nonpenetrating; adult; Article; blunt trauma; controlled study; crowding (area); exploratory research; female; forensic science; gunshot injury; human; injury; male; Peru; priority journal; prison; terrorism; weapon; body remains; forensic anthropology; multiple trauma; pathology; prisoner",,,,,,,"Crettol M., La A.M.; Groom D., Right to Know: Its Distinction from the Right to Truth, (2015); Tidball-Binz M., Global forensic science and the search for the dead and missing from armed conflict: the perspective of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Forensic Science: Current Issues, Future Directions, pp. 337-365, (2012); ICRC, Missing People, DNA Analysis and Identification of Human Remains: A Guide to Best Practice in Armed Conflicts and Other Situations of Armed Violenc, (2009); (2014); Pretty I.A., Sweet D., A look at forensic dentistry ? part 1: the role of teeth in the determination of human identity?, Br.

Particular attention is paid to identifying the mechanisms of injury and determination of the most probable cause of death based on the assessment of lethal or lethal-if-untreated injuries recorded in the skeleton. It was calculated that at least 38.9% (155/398) of individuals sustained gunshot wounds (GSWs) (plus one shrapnel wound) and may have died as consequence of these injuries. Among individuals who died from GSWs, there were 142 males (91.60%), eight females (5.1%) and five cases that were (3.2%) undetermined. One male individual sustained shrapnel injuries. This study presents an example of the multidisciplinary approach to the effective forensic investigation of violation against International Humanitarian Law, as well as an example of how it is possible to obtain meaningful results to assist the needs of the prosecution in these kind of cases despite the large number of cases and technological constraints.

The appropriate management of these incidents, particularly of the bodies, is one of the most crucial aspects of disaster response and its importance has led to the evolution of the concept of Disaster Victim Management. The aim of this study is to report how the process of identifying the 12 mortal victims of a railway accident in June 2010 in Castelldefels (Barcelona) was managed. The methodology used complied with the National Protocol for medical forensic and scientific police response to mass casualty incidents. The family assistance center also served as an ante mortem (AM) office. Despite the fragmentation of the bodies, all the victims were identified satisfactorily. The main problems observed during the management of the disaster were due to the state of the bodies, which raised many doubts as to the number of fatalities. The experience prompted a proposal to establish some recommendations on limiting the number of fragments to be analyzed genetically. We would like to stress the importance of setting up a Data Integration Center which brought together all the participating institutions, and collected and supervised all the different identification reports in a single comprehensive text addressed to the competent legal authority. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Disaster victim identification; Disaster Victim Management; Forensic Pathology; Human identification,Accidents; Adolescent; Adult; Disaster Victims; DNA Fingerprinting; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Male; Mass Casualty Incidents; Railroads; Spain; Young Adult; adult; Article; clinical article; disaster victim; family counseling; female; forensic identification; human; male; mass disaster; methodology; police; railway; traffic accident; accident; adolescent; disaster victim; DNA fingerprinting; physical anthropology; procedures; railway; Spain; young adult,,,,,,,"Byard R.W., Winskog C., Potential problems arising during international disaster victim identification (DVI) exercises, Forensic Sci Med Pathol, 6, pp. 1-2, (2010); La gestión de cadáveres en situaciones de desastre: Guía práctica para equipos de respuesta, (2006); The DVI Response to the South East Asian Tsunami between December 2004 and February 2006, (2014); Winskog C., Tsokos M., Byard R.W., The progression from disaster victim identification (DVI) to disaster victim management (DVM): a necessary evolution, Forensic Sci Med Pathol, 8, pp. 81-83, (2012); Schuliar Y., Knudsen P.J.T., Role of forensic pathologists in mass disasters, Forensic Sci Med Pathol, 8, pp. 164-173, (2012); Vallejo G., Alonso A., La identificación genética en grandes catástrofes: avances científicos y normativos en España, Rev Esp Med Legal, 35, pp. 19-27, (2009); Arcos Gonzalez P., Perez-Berrocal A.J., Castro Delgado R., Cadavieco Gonzalez B., Mortalidad y morbilidad por desastres en España, Gac Sanit, 20, pp. 481-484, (2006); Informe final sobre el accidente ferroviario n° 0030/2010 ocurrido el 23.06.2010 en el apeadero de Platja de Castelldefels (Barcelona), Secretaría de Estado de Transportes; Real Decreto 32/2009, de 16 de enero, por el que se aprueba el Protocolo nacional de actuación Médico-Forense y de Policía Científica en sucesos con víctimas múltiples, 32, (2009); Real Decreto 1977/2008, de 28 de noviembre, por el que se regula la composición y funciones de la Comisión Nacional para el uso forense del ADN, 298, (2008); Actividades 2009-2010, (2014); Disaster Victim Identification Guide, (2013); Orden JUS/215/2010, de 27 de enero, por la que se modifica la Orden de 24 de febrero de 1999, por la que se fija la cuantía de los precios públicos de los servicios prestados por el Instituto de Toxicología, 33, (2010); Barberia-Marcalain E., Intervención médico-forense en sucesos con múltiples víctimas mortales: la experiencia del accidente de aviación de Barajas, Rev Esp Med Legal, 35, pp. 1-2, (2009); Prieto J.L., Tortosa C., Bedate A., Segura L., Abenza J.M., Mariscal de Gante M.C., Conejero J., Magana C., Perea B., The 11 March 2004 terrorist attacks: the importance of the mortuary organization for identification of victims.

The primary role of a forensic anthropologist is to evaluate human skeletal remains and ascertain the biological profile of the deceased. Forensic anthropologists thus use their expertise to assist medical examiners, as well as law enforcement agencies. Forensic anthropology was not recognised as a subject specialty of much significance in most parts of the world for a long time. However, now its status has changed, mostly in the USA and parts of Europe. The scope of the subject ranges from evaluation of human skeletal remains to the identification of the living. In the new millennium, the role of forensic anthropologists includes disaster victim identification, photographic superimposition, facial image reconstruction in CCTV footage, gait pattern analysis from video surveillance, ascertaining the age of an individual in absence of legal documents and paedo-pornographic materials. Despite its relevance in human identification, the development of forensic anthropology in India is not very encouraging. Only a few institutions in India include forensic anthropology as a part of the forensic science degree programme, and there are no certified courses in anthropology either. Likewise, there are limited employment opportunities for forensic anthropologists in medical institutes/organisations/universities. This comprehensive review focuses on the status and development of forensic anthropology in India and emphasises the need for its recognition as a specialty of significance. The article also throws light on the comparison of its status in the Indian context vis a vis developed nations. © The Author(s) 2019.",DVI; forensic anthropology; Forensic medicine; human remains; identification; India,Age Determination by Skeleton; Body Height; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; India; Professional Role; Sex Determination by Skeleton; body height; bone age determination; education; forensic anthropology; human; India; organization and management; professional standard; sex determination,,,,,"International Academy of Legal Medicine; Panjab University, Chandigarh; Department of Anthropology, McMaster University; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, ??????; University Grants Commission, UGC; University Grants Committee, UGC","Funding text 1: The authors received the following financial support for the research, authorship and /or publication of this article: University Grants Commission research fellowship, New Delhi, India; a DST PURSE Grant, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India; and a UGC Centre of Advanced Study (CAS) awarded to the Department of Anthropology, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India.; Funding text 2: This review article is the outcome of the authors? experiences (KK and TK) in the field of forensic anthropology for more than a decade and a half.

After briefly reviewing the typical wound appearance of projectile trauma in the cranium, we discuss the presence of an intact bone plug associated with a gunshot exit wound in an individual from the Tuskulenai Case. While this individual demonstrated typical gunshot entry and exit wounds to the cranium consistent with high-velocity trauma, the bone plug indicates that the projectile likely lost much of its kinetic energy while traveling through the cranium resulting in a low-velocity impact at the exit site.

While it is axiomatic that forensic anthropologists have a detailed understanding of the human skeleton, it is the practitioners? expertise in the analysis of differentially preserved human remains that today is at the heart of the discipline. In addition to the context of the case (whether a missing person, disaster victim identification, war grave recovery, cases of political, ethnic or religious violence, or questions pertaining to the living), the preservation and condition of the remains inevitably influences the extent to which the forensic anthropologist plays a role. This paper outlines different contexts where forensic anthropologists have contributed to forensic cases, and reflects on the influence of geography (and therefore political context) on the volume of cases requiring the expertise of forensic anthropologists in different countries. Consideration is then given to the developing state of professional practice and research in forensic anthropology, as well as the expanding repertoire of the forensic anthropologist?s work. © 2018, © Crown Copyright in the Commonwealth of Australia Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine.",context; contributions; Forensic anthropology; medico-legal death investigations; public perception,article; death; forensic anthropology; geography; human; perception; professional practice,,,,,"American Academy of Forensic Sciences, AAFS","I was honoured to be invited to give one of the four keynote presentations at the one day symposium to acknowledge the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS), and thank the organizing committee for arranging the symposium.

The potential contributions made by forensic anthropology are illustrated through the presentation of a case study. In February 2009 the state of Victoria in south-eastern Australia experienced the most devastating bushfires in its history, resulting in catastrophic loss of life and public and private property. Within 48. h of the disaster, forensic teams including pathologists, odontologists and anthropologists assembled at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne to begin the task of identifying the deceased. This paper reviews the part played by forensic anthropologists in the identification process and outlines the important contribution anthropologists can make to DVI, especially at the scene, in the mortuary and in the reconciliation process. The anthropologist's experience with differentially preserved human remains meant they played an important role identifying and recovering heavily fragmentary human skeletal remains, differentiating human from non-human remains, establishing basic biological information such as the sex and age of the individuals and confirming or denying the possibility of re-associating body parts for release to families. © 2010.",Disasters;

To date radiography has played an important role in the disaster victim identification (DVI) process. The aim of this paper is to highlight the benefits of applying computed tomography (CT) technology to the DVI process. The paper begins by reviewing the extent to which sophisticated imaging techniques, specifically CT, have been increasingly used to assist in the analysis of deceased individuals. A small scale case study is then presented which describes aspects of the DVI process following a recent Australian aviation disaster involving two individuals. Having grided the scene of the disaster, a total of 41 bags of heavily disrupted human remains were collected. A postmortem examination was subsequently undertaken. Analysis of the CT images of all body parts (n = 162) made it possible not only to identify and side differentially preserved skeletal elements which were anatomically unrecognizable in the heavily disrupted body masses, but also to observe and record useful identifying features such as surgical implants. In this case the role of the forensic anthropologist and CT technology were paramount in facilitating a quick identification, and subsequently, an effective and timely reconciliation, of body parts. Although this case study is small scale, it illustrates the enormous potential for CT imaging to complement the existing DVI process. © 2008 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Computed tomography;

To present individual body identification efforts, as part of the World Trade Center (WTC) mass disaster identification project. Methods. More than 500 samples were tested by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and short tandem repeat (STR) typing. The extent to which the remains were fragmented and affected by taphonomic factors complicated the identification project. Anthropologists reviewed 19,000 samples, and detected inconsistencies in 69, which were further split into 239 new cases and re-sampled by DNA specialists. Results. The severity and nature of the disaster required an interdisciplinary effort. DNA profiling of 500 samples was successful in 75% of the cases. All discrepancies, which occurred between bone and tissue samples taken from the same body part, were resolved by re-sampling and re-testing of preferably bone tissue. Anthropologists detected inconsistencies in 69 cases, which were then split into 239 new cases. Out of 125 ""split"" cases, 65 were excluded from their original case. Of these 65 cases, 37 did not match any profiles in M-FISys, probably because profiles were incomplete or no exemplar for the victim was available. Out of the 60 remains not excluded from their original case, 30 were partial profiles and did not reach the statistical requirement to match their original case, because the population frequency of the DNA profile had to be =1 in 109 for men and =1 in 108 for women. Conclusion. Due to transfer of soft tissue and other commingling of remains, DNA testing alone would have led to problems if only soft tissue would have been tested. This was one of the reasons that forensic anthropologists were needed to evaluate the consistency between all linked body parts. Especially in disasters with a high potential for commingling, the described anthropological review process should be part of the investigation.",Bone and bones; Disasters; DNA; Forensic anthropology; Polymerase chain reaction; Tandem repeat sequences,DNA Fingerprinting; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; New York City; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tandem Repeat Sequences; Terrorism; article; disaster; DNA determination; DNA fingerprinting; fatality; forensic identification; gene amplification; human; human tissue; physical anthropology; polymerase chain reaction; tandem repeat; taphonomy; terrorism; United States,,,,,,,"Wiersema J.M., Bartelink E.J., Budimlija Z., Prinz M., Shaler R.C., Zelson Mundorff A., Et al., The importance of an interdisciplinary review process in the World Trade Center mass disaster investigation, Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of American Academy of Forensic Sciences, (2003); Mundorff Zelson A., The role of anthropology during the identification of victims from the World Trade Center disaster, Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of American Academy of Forensic Sciences, (2003); Primorac D., Andelinovic S., Definis-Gojanovic M., Drmic I., Rezic B., Baden M.M., Et al., Identification of war victims from mass graves in Croatia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina by use of standard forensic methods and DNA typing, J Forensic Sci, 41, pp. 891-894, (1996); Alonso A., Andelinovic S., Martin P., Sutlovic D., Erceg I., Huffine E., Et al., DNA typing from skeletal remains: Evaluation of multiplex and megaplex STR systems on DNA isolated from bone and teeth samples, Croat Med J, 42, pp. 260-266, (2001); Budimlija Z.M., Nazaruollo B., Estacio S.M., Prinz M.K., Shaler R.C., Bone extraction procedure for nuclear DNA analysis used in World Trade Center Human Identification Project, Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of American Academy of Forensic Sciences, (2003); Gill P., Ivanov P.L., Kimpton C., Piercy R., Benson N., Tully G., Et al., Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis, Nat Genet, 6, pp. 130-135, (1994); Clayton T.M., Whitaker J.P., Maguire C.N., Identification of bodies from the scene of a mass disaster using DNA amplification of short tandem repeat (STR) loci, Forensic Sci Int, 76, pp. 7-15, (1995); Clayton T.M., Whitaker J.P., Fisher D.L., Lee D.A., Holland M.M., Weedn V.W., Et al., Further validation of a quadruplex STR DNA typing system: A collaborative effort to identify victims of a mass disaster, Forensic Sci Int, 76, pp. 17-25, (1995); Whitaker J.P., Clayton T.M., Urquhart A.J., Millican E.S., Downes T.J., Kimpton C.P., Et al., Short tandem repeat typing of bodies from a mass disaster: High success rate and characteristic amplification patterns in highly degraded samples, Biotechniques, 18, pp. 670-677, (1995); Huffine E., Crews J., Kennedy B., Bomberger K., Zinbo A., Mass identification of persons missing from the break-up of the former Yugoslavia: Structure, function, and role of the International Commission on Missing Persons, Croat Med J, 42, pp. 271-275, (2001); Gabriel M.N., Calloway C.D., Reynolds R.L., Andelinovic S., Primorac D., Population variation of human mitochondrial DNA hypervariable regions I and II in 105 Croatian individuals demonstrated by immobilized sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe analysis, Croat Med J, 42, pp. 328-335, (2001)","Z.M.

The local March weather conditions had been wet, and heavy rains fell during the 2-day process of casket removal. The extremely wet soil and the poor preservation of two wooden caskets increased the likelihood of damage to evidence. After remains' transport to the forensic center, an indoor wet-screening station was established so that skeletal elements could be (i) separated from soil matrix and (ii) preserved carefully for analysis. Not only were the remains relatively small and fragile in comparison with those of an adult, but two of the three remains were known to be fire damaged, thus the use of special laboratory preparation techniques was crucial. © 2010 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",burned skeletal remains; forensic anthropology; forensic recovery; forensic science; perimortem fractures; wet screening,Adult; Cemeteries; Exhumation; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Homicide; Humans; Infant; Male; Rain; Soil; Water; rain; water; adult; article; case report; exhumation; female; homicide; human; infant; instrumentation; male; methodology; physical anthropology; posthumous care; soil,,"water, 7732-18-5; Soil, ; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,,"Steadman D., Diantonio L., Wilson J., Sheridan K., Tammariello S., The effects of chemical and heat maceration techniques on the recovery of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from bone, J Forensic Sci, 51, 1, pp. 11-17, (2006); Fenton T., Birkby W., Cornelison J., A fast and safe non-bleaching method for forensic skeletal preparation, J Forensic Sci, 48, pp. 274-276, (2003); Rennick S., Fenton T., Foran D., The effects of skeletal preparation techniques on DNA from human and nonhuman bone, Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, (2005); Pope E.J., Smith O.C., Identification of traumatic injury in burned cranial bones: An experimental approach, J Forensic Sci, 49, 3, pp. 431-440, (2004); Ubelaker D., The forensic evaluation of burned skeletal remains: A synthesis, Forensic Sci Int, 183, 1, pp. 1-5, (2009); The Analysis of Burned Human Remains, (2008); Dupras T., Schultz J., Wheeler S., Williams L., Forensic Recovery of Human Remains, (2006); Cox M., Flavel A., Hanson I., Laver J., Wessling R., The Scientific Investigation of Mass Graves: Toward Protocols and Standard Operating Procedures, (2007); Webster A., Recovery of a Vietnam-era aircraft crash: Use of cross-cultural understanding and dual forensic recovery methods, J Forensic Sci, 43, 2, pp. 277-283, (1998)","A.

It was located approximately 100 km south-east of Zagreb on the banks of the Sava River. Although the purpose of, and number of deaths in, the camp have been debated, it appears that a significant number of Serbs, Roma and Jews died and/or were executed at this site between 1941 and 1945. The site demonstrates that not all detention camps at this time were controlled by the German government and that cultural/religious groups other than the Jews were detainees.

The relatively new field of forensic anthropology and its trained professionals occupy an essential place in the investigation of cases of missing and unidentified individuals. The development of forensic anthropology in Brazil is unique among Latin American countries, who improved their expertise during the investigations of political crimes that occurred between the 1960s and 1980s in most places. The qualifications and the paths to become a forensic anthropologist in Brazil are different from other professionals who work in the field worldwide. This article addresses the issue of missing person investigations and details the work of forensic anthropologists in such cases in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Brazil; Forensic anthropology population data; Humanitarian; Missing persons,"Body Remains; Brazil; Cooperative Behavior; Data Collection; Databases, Genetic; DNA Fingerprinting; Forensic Anthropology; Government Agencies; Humans; adult; article; Brazil; crime; forensic anthropology; human; body remains; Brazil; cooperation; DNA fingerprinting; forensic anthropology; genetic database; government; information processing; organization and management",,,,,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (99999.013091/2013-01)","Edits and improvements to the original manuscript were made possible thanks to Stephanie Oshrin, Dr. Steve Oshrin, Dr. Joanne Oshrin, Dr. Cristina Cattaneo as editor, and anonymous reviewers.

Sixty-one victims were recovered in the rubble of the building, and five people were unaccounted for. All the bodies were well preserved except for two who had been burmed. The majority of the victims were identified visually or by comparing body features, clothing, or personal effects with information collected from relatives or friends. Positive identifications of the two victims who were burned were obtained by dental comparison and DNA analysis. Approximately half of the victims (51.6%) sustained fatal injuires, while the remainder died from asphyxia. The injuries were characterized using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and the New Injury Severity Score (NISS) systems. Injury severity associated with the location of victims inside the apartment may provide useful information for those involved in building design and/or search and rescue operations.

We apply a Bayesian technique to incorporate non-genetic variables in the construction of prior information. In that way, we can learn from the already-solved cases of a particular mass event of death, and use that information to guide the search among remaining victims. This paper describes a particular application to the proposed method to the identification of human remains of the so-called disappeared during the last dictatorship in Argentina, which lasted from 1976 until 1983. Potential applications of the techniques presented hereby, however, are much wider. The central idea of our work is to take advantage of the already-solved cases within a certain event to use the gathered knowledge to assist in the investigation process, enabling the construction of prioritized rankings of victims that could correspond to each certain unidentified human remains. © 2020, The Author(s).",,adult; Argentina; article; authority; human; mass disaster; victim,,,,,,,"Penchaszadeh V., Use of dna identification in human rights, work to reunite families in latin america, Els, (2001); Cordner S., McKelvie H., Developing standards in international forensic work to identify missing persons, Int.

My hypothesis is that these links are inextricable from the mode of operation that defined the EAAF, which can be called ?forensic activism?. This kind of activism, outside the State, combined scientific expertise with humanitarian sensitivity, defined by its autonomy from the human rights movement and the national scientific system (both academic and university). Moreover, religion emerged constantly from the type of work undertaken, between the living and the dead. Thus, beliefs, with their prohibitions, rituals, and ways of making sense of suffering and their tools for coming to terms with grief, coexisted with the EAAF?s development. These findings emerge from a qualitative research design combining document analysis, in-depth interviews, and participative observation of scientific disclosure open to the public provided by the EAAF over the past three years. © 2020 by the author.

Moreover, they had practically no subsidies, but only individual grants funded by the AAAS (Cohen Salama 1992, p. 181), and some equipment funded by the Ford Foundation (Celesia 2019, p. 82).; Funding text 2: 12 WOLA was founded in 1974 by leaders of different churches in USA who were concerned about repression in Latin America. Their main mission was to connect policy-makers in Washington with people who had first-hand knowledge of the thousands of deaths, disappearances, torture cases, and unfair imprisonments that occurred under the dictatorships of that time. It included many members or former members of religious institutions, especially Catholic, Protestant and Jewish, e.g., Joe Eldridge (director), a former Methodist pastor; Jo Marie Griesgraber, former Catholic nun; William Wipfler of the National Council of Churches, Tom Quigley of the Conference of Catholic Bishops, and Peggy Healy, who was still a Maryknoll nun, among others. 13 In 2003, WOLA called upon the EAAF to participate in action against the femicides in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico (Celesia 2019, p. 239). Moreover, during those years, the association with WOLA was key to persuading US senators to endorse the request for funding for a network of forensic anthropology teams, made up of the EAAF, the Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team (Equipo Peruano de Antropología Forense (EPAF)) and the Guatemala Forensic Anthropology Foundation (Fundación de Antropología Forense de Guatemala (FAFG)). This funding enabled the EAAF to see its dream come true in 2006, when its own genetic laboratory was founded. (Interview with EAAF founding member, 9 September 2020). See also: https://eaaf.org/laboratorio-de-genetica-forense/ (accessed on 28 September 2020).

Since 2014, Italy has been struggling in an almost indifferent international scenario to identify its dead migrants. Despite the lack of sufficient resources, of the difficulties in collecting post mortem data from the disseminated bodies, and of the problems of contacting and collecting ante mortem information from relatives, it has been proven, with a series of pilot studies, that not only can these bodies be identified but that relatives are also looking for their loved ones and need death certificates. This article focuses on the administrative limbo and lack of regulations obliging single states to engage in appropriate procedures to maximise identification. © 2022, The Author(s).",Ambiguous loss; Dead migrants; Humanitarian forensic sciences; Identification; Identification strategy; Mediterranean,Autopsy; Disasters; Europe; Humans; Italy; Transients and Migrants; autopsy; disaster; Europe; human; Italy; migration,,,,,"Fondazione Isacchi Samaja and Terres des Hommes; ICRC; Swiss Red Cross; American Academy of Forensic Sciences, AAFS","We wish to thank Fondazione Isacchi Samaja and Terres des Hommes for their precious support in our projects without which much of this would not have been possible.

Anthropological analysis, including imaging using high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning, was used to assess skeletal trauma, which involved thermal alterations as well as sharp trauma. Due to fire-related discoloration of the bone, sharp traumas on the cranium of the adult were difficult to appreciate visually, but CT imaging helped to significantly improve visualization of the alterations. CT imaging also facilitated the preservation of the conditions of all four crania, which were appreciably altered by the fire, and for the adult individual reconstructed from multiple fragments. The contributions of various agencies and laboratory analyses, including forensic anthropological imaging, helped contribute to the successful resolution of the case. © 2023 University of Florida Press.",CT scanning; forensic anthropology; sharp trauma; thermal alterations,,,,,,,,,"A.M.

This article presents an analysis of eight mass graves. Evidence from these graves strongly suggests that the bodies are those of victims of extrajudicial killings during a purge from a transition period between the end of the war and the beginning of a more controlled, though brutal, postwar repression (1940-42). Although our work was not part of a formal medicolegal investigation, we argue that the context warranted such and the approach used in this and similar situations should be forensic. We also suggest that forensic practitioners go further in their interpretation than we have seen in past exhumations to include the incorporation of multiple lines of evidence, reflecting holistic archaeological and anthropological practice and expertise. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.",Exhumation; Forensic anthropology; Forensic archaeology; Social justice; Spanish Civil War,,,,,,,,"Informe de la Dirección de Campo: 11 de Octubre de 2007, (2007); Bass W.M., Human Osteology: A Laboratory and Field Manual, (1995); Baviano J.M., El juicio contra el alcalde de Torremegía el recuerdo de los fusilamientos de 1936, (1980); Bernardi P., Fondebrider L., Forensic Archaeology and the Scientific Documentation of Human Rights Violations: An Argentinian Example from the Early 1980s, Forensic Archaeology and Human Rights Violations.

As a result of disinterested postwar governments, nongovernmental organizations-representing families of victims-have insisted on finding the graves and exhuming the dead for identification and repatriation. This study examines skeletal gunshot trauma patterns from three extrajudicial mass execution sites and compares them with trauma of those from a postwar prison site, where victims were given more formal legal proceedings. Chi-square tests of cranial and postcranial trauma show that the latter is significantly more common at the postwar site. Further study of evidence from these sites will help ascertain circumstances of death and will help bring a measure of justice to victim families, even if future governments continue to deny official investigation. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.",Extrajudicial execution; Forensic anthropology; Perimortem trauma; Spanish Civil War,,,,,,,,"Armengou Montse, Belis Ricard, Las Fosas del Silencio, (2004); Bores Maria, Isabel Ortega Ana, Miguel Carretero Jose, Cristobal Eduardo, Martinez de Pinillos Marina, ¿Quiénes están enterrados en las fosas de Costaján?

Forensic science has a humanitarian application as well as being a tool for justice. Identification of the dead is an essential component of the proper involvement of a forensic professional in dealing with human remains. Managing large numbers of deaths following a disaster or in a post-conflict environment, from the point of view of human identification, is a completely different exercise compared with everyday work.

This occurred a little over a week after a heat wave in which over 400 people were thought to have died prematurely in southeastern Australia. The Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in collaboration with the police force and the State Coroner's Office and over 100 colleagues from all over Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and Japan implemented a DVI process based on Interpol guidelines to identify the deceased persons. CT scanning was conducted on all remains collected and played a pivotal role in the identification processes in conjunction with experts in pathology, anthropology, forensic odontology and molecular biology. This paper outlines the scale of the disaster and the work, from a forensic medical perspective, to identify the deceased. © 2010.",Disaster victim identification; Forensic pathology; Forensic science; Victorian bushfires,article; Australia; autopsy; bushfire; computer assisted tomography; coroner; dentistry; disaster planning; emergency ward; forensic identification; forensic pathology; forensic science; greenhouse effect; heat injury; human; Indonesia; Japan; mass disaster; molecular biology; mortality; natural disaster; New Zealand; physical anthropology; police; priority journal; psychotherapy,,,,,,,"(2009); (2009); Cameron P.A., Et al., Black Saturday: the immediate impact of the February 2009 bushfires in Victoria, Australia, Med.

The experiences gained from some of the latest DVI operations have provided valuable lessons that have had an effect on the role and perceived value of the forensic anthropologist as part of the team managing the DVI process. This paper provides an overview of the ways in which forensic anthropologists may contribute to DVI with emphasis on how recent experiences and developments in forensic anthropology have augmented these contributions. Consequently, this paper reviews the value of forensic anthropological expertise at the disaster scene and in the mortuary, and discusses the way in which forensic anthropologists may use imaging in DVI efforts. Tissue-sampling strategies for DNA analysis, especially in the case of disasters with a large amount of fragmented remains, are also discussed. Additionally, consideration is given to the identification of survivors; the statistical basis of identification; the challenges related to some specific disaster scenarios; and education and training. Although forensic anthropologists can play a valuable role in different phases of a DVI operation, they never practice in isolation. The DVI process requires a multidisciplinary approach and, therefore, has a close collaboration with a range of forensic specialists. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This statement has been issued taking into account the international migration crises related to thousands of deaths worldwide, in which the utility of these traditional means of identification has been sporadic to non-existent. The statement is however not limited to deaths related to the migration crises, as similar problems may occur in fatalities en masse such as in natural disasters and armed conflicts, and on a smaller scale in cases of homeless or otherwise socioeconomically disadvantaged persons. The number of reports on personal identification based on sound anthropological methodology is increasing in the scientific literature. However, more research is needed to develop evidence-based standard operating procedures and statistical frameworks. It remains essential to raise awareness among forensic practitioners, law enforcement, and judiciary professionals on the utility of forensic anthropology in cases where it can provide sufficient information for identification. © 2020",Antemortem; DVI; Forensic anthropology; Identification; Methodology; Postmortem,"Bone and Bones; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mass Casualty Incidents; Photography; Societies, Scientific; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; adult; article; awareness; cell migration; controlled study; Europe; fatality; finger dermatoglyphics; forensic anthropology; genetic analysis; human; law enforcement; natural disaster; odontology; physician; scientific literature; sound; war; anatomy and histology; bone; diagnostic imaging; health care organization; mass disaster; photography; three-dimensional imaging; x-ray computed tomography",,,,,,,"Boss P., The trauma and complicated grief of ambiguous loss, Pastor.

The related disaster victim identification (DVI) operations are invariably challenging, with the state of the remains potentially precluding some identifications. Practitioners involved in these DVI operations will routinely face logistical, practical, and ethical challenges. This review provides information and guidance derived from first-hand experiences to individuals tasked with managing DVI operations with fragmented human remains. We outline several key issues that should be addressed during disaster preparedness planning and at the outset of an operation, when incident-specific strategies are developed. Specific challenges during recovery and examination of fragmented remains are addressed, highlighting the importance of experienced specialists at the scene and in the mortuary. DNA sample selection and sampling techniques are reviewed, as well as downstream effects of commingling and contamination, which can complicate reconciliation and emphasise the need for rigorous quality control. We also touch on issues that may arise during communication with families. While recommendations are provided, they are not intended as proscriptive policy but rather as an addition to the general recommendations given in the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) DVI Guide, to inform preparative discussions between government officials, judiciary, police, and forensic specialists.Key points A DVI operation for an incident characterised by many fragmented and otherwise compromised human remains poses specific challenges that may prolong and complicate identifications. Specialists should be consulted at the outset to address key issues related to the aim and extent of the operation. Specialist expertise in handling compromised human remains is indispensable at the scene, in the mortuary, during reconciliation, and for quality control. Continuous consultation between representatives from government, the judiciary, law enforcement, the media, and various forensic specialists will prevent unnecessary delay and facilitate accurate and timely communication. © 2020 The Author(s).

Often disasters coincide with the loss of numerous lives. The recovery, identification and repatriation of the (remains of the) victims is vital to the mourning process of the relatives and is needed for legal clearing. All efforts made for this purpose are referred to as Disaster Victim Identification (DVT). Over the past decades, the Dutch DVI team has made several contributions to increase the efficiency of the internationally accepted Interpol DVI-procedures. This article presents, from a medical officer's point of view, the basics of a disaster victim identification response and discusses some of the recent methodological advances used by the Dutch DVI team.",Disaster victim identification; DNA-analysis; Forensic anthropology; Forensic pathology; Interpol; Mass fatality incident,disaster victim; DNA determination; forensic pathology; human; mass disaster; medical personnel; physical anthropology,,,,,,,"International Federation of Red Cross and Red Cresent Societies. - What is a Disaster, (2015); Home Office Communication Directorate. - Guidance on Dealing with Fatalities in Emergencies, (2015); Interpol Resolution AGN/65/RES/13 Interpol, (2015); Interpol Disaster Victim Identification Guide, (2013); Morgan B., Alminyah A., Cala A., O'Donnel C., Elliott D., Gorincour G., Hofman P., Lino M., Makino Y., Moskata A., Robinson C., Rutty G.N., Sjantila A., Vallis J., Woodford N., Wtoniak K., Viner M., Use of post-mortem computed tomography in disaster victim identification.

For investigators and justice, terrorists must also be identified in a timely manner. The fragmentation of bodies caused by explosive devices however makes this operation difficult. The cases presented correspond to six autopsies of perpetrators carrying explosives. Their explosive belts produced different body sections on areas correlated with the location on the body of carrying explosive charges. Indeed, cross-sectional areas are the signature of the level of explosive devices on the body, and some fracture features through the damage of certain areas of constitutional weaknesses are specific elements to consider. These elements can allow a quick distinction between victims and terrorists, in order to assist in the medico-legal process of identification. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Anthropology; Blast injuries; Bone traumas; Forensic medicine; Suicide bombing,"Blast Injuries; Explosions; Forensic Medicine; Fractures, Multiple; Humans; Terrorism; blast injury; diagnostic imaging; explosion; forensic medicine; human; multiple fracture; pathology; terrorism",,,,,Lilia Hamza,"We would like to express our sincere appreciation to Céline Deguette, Charlotte Gorgiard, Isabelle Sec, and Lilia Hamza.","Giles J., Hopkin M., Psychologists warn of more suicide attacks in the wake of London bombs, Nature, 436, pp. 308-309, (2005); Carli P., Pons F., Levraut J., Millet B., Tourtier J.P., Ludes B., Lafont A., Riou B., The French emergency medical services after the Paris and Nice terrorist attacks: What have we learnt?, Lancet, (2017); Quatrehomme G., Toupenay S., Delabarde T., Padovani B., Alunni V., Forensic answers to the 14th of July 2016 terrorist attack in Nice, Int J Legal Med, (2018); Prieto J.L., Tortosa C., Bedate A., Segura L., Abenza J.M., Mariscal de Gante M.C., Conejero J., Magana C., Perea B., The 11 March 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks: the importance of the mortuary organisation for identification of victims.

In 2015, the NYC OCME received over 400 decedents whose identities were initially reported as unknown. The HCIFS received 226 unknown decedent cases in 2015. These offices have faced similar challenges in the past when pursuing identification of long-term and otherwise complex identification cases. Within the past decade, the NYC OCME and HCIFS have successfully integrated forensic anthropologists into their offices to supervise routine identifications, direct resolution efforts in complex identification cases, manage disaster victim identification efforts, and organize community outreach events focused on identification. Accordingly, the NYC OCME and HCIFS anthropologists have successfully streamlined identification procedures to make them more efficient for all cases, and increased identifications of completely unknown individuals, effectively discharging the statutory responsibility held by the Chief Medical Examiner for decedent identification. © 2016 Academic Forensic Pathology International.",Forensic anthropology; Forensic pathology; Medicolegal identification; Missing persons,,,,,,,,"NamUs: National missing and unidentified persons system [Internet], (2016); Mass fatality incidents: a guide for human forensic identification [Internet], (2005); Mehta A., Dhariwal S., Design and implementation of features based on fingerprint image matching system, Int J Multidiscip Curr Res, 2, 6, pp. 1183-1190, (2014); Kaushal N., Kaushal P., Human identification and fingerprints: a review, J Biomet Biostat, 2, 4, pp. 1-5, (2011); Fournier N.A., Ross A.H., Sex, ancestral, and pattern type variation of fingerprint minutiae: a forensic perspective on anthropological dermatoglyphics, Am J Phys Anthropol, 160, 4, pp. 625-632, (2016); Neumann C., Stern H., Forensic examination of fingerprints: past, present, and future, Chance, 29, 1, pp. 9-16, (2016); Dirkmaat D., A companion to forensic anthropology, pp. 136-156; Kontanis E.J., Sledzik P.S., Recovery, analysis, and identification of commingled human remains, pp. 317-336; Mundorf A.Z., Recovery, analysis, and identification of commingled human remains, pp. 123-144; Steadman D.W., Sperry K., Snow F., Et al., Recovery, analysis, and identification of commingled human remains, pp. 81-96; Steadman D.W., Forensic science: current issues, future directions, pp. 131-159, (2013)","S.M.

Nearly a hundred of them died within the next seven months upon their arrival, and were buried in a clandestine mass grave in a nearby forest. However, the exact nature of their death is unknown, as it is unclear what the attitude of the aggressors was toward the victims. We do not know whether there was only one executioner or there were several assassins, nor if the killing methodology was consistent with the other state-regulated executions. The studied material represents the commingled remains of a minimum thirty-four people, possibly all male, aged from under eighteen to over sixty at the time of death. Perimortem traumatic lesions are shown mainly on the skull bones. We asked whether the perimortem trauma lesions visible on the victims? skeletons could be informative on the cause and manner of their death. Our results show the prevalence of the perimortem trauma inflicted by a blunt object are on the parietal bones above the Hat Brim Line (HBL), which is commonly associated with a violent attack. The gunshot trauma was usually localized on the occipital bone or posterior parietal, which could indicate a shot to the back of the head, and this was commonly encountered during executions. No signs of defensive injuries can be explained either by restraining of the hands or by a surprise attack. The abundance and variability of the trauma type can be evident of multiple assailants. Moreover, the multiple impact points detected on several crania prove unnecessary overkill and brutality, which reflects the personal attitudes of the executioners towards the victims. © 2023 The Author(s)",Commingled remains; Forensic anthropology; Genocide; Mass grave analysis; Perimortem trauma interpretation; World War II,"Ethnic Cleansing; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Male; World War II; Wounds, Gunshot; adult; Article; ethnic cleansing; forensic anthropology; genocide; gunshot injury; human; male; occipital bone; prevalence; skeleton; skull; time of death; victim; war; ethnic cleansing; gunshot injury",,,,,John and Beata Mayston; National Institute of Remembrance,"We thank the National Institute of Remembrance for their permission to publish our study results.

Analysis of blast injury features little in anthropological literature. We present a review of clinical literature that includes prevalence of injury to anatomical regions and potential indicators of blast injury which can be used by forensic anthropologists. This includes high prevalence of extremity (22.8-91.2%) and facial (19.6-40%) injury in combat contexts, lower limb fractures (19-74.3%) in suicide bombing, traumatic amputation (3-43%) and diffuse fracture patterns in terrorist bombings. Potential indicators of blast trauma include blowout fractures in sinus cavities from blast overpressure, transverse mandibular fractures, and visceral surface rib fractures. Ability to recognize blast trauma and distinguish it in the skeleton is of importance in investigations and judicial proceedings relating to war crimes, terrorism, and human rights violations and likely to become increasingly crucial to forensic anthropology knowledge. © 2014 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Blast injury; Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Patterns; Trauma; Trauma interpretation,"Blast Injuries; Diagnosis, Differential; Explosive Agents; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Pathology; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Multiple Trauma; Physical Phenomena; Wounds, Gunshot; explosive; blast injury; chemistry; differential diagnosis; forensic pathology; fracture; gunshot injury; human; multiple trauma; pathology; physical anthropology; physical phenomena",,"Explosive Agents, ",,,,,"Fiorato V., Blood red roses - the archaeology of a mass grave from the Battle of Towton AD 1461, (2000); Thordeman B., Armour from the Battle of Wisby (reprint edition), (2001); Wahl J., Konig H.G., Anthropologisch-traumatologische untersuchung der menschlichen skeletresste aus dem bandkeramischen massengrab bei talheim, kreiss heilbronn, Fundberichte aus Baden-Württemburg, 12, pp. 65-193, (1987); Stover E., Haglund W.D., Samuels M., Exhumation of mass graves in Iraq, JAMA, 290, 5, pp. 663-666, (2003); Steele C., Archaeology and the forensic investigation of recent mass graves: ethical issues for a new practice of archaeology, Archaeologies, 4, 3, pp. 414-428, (2008); Bowyer G.W., Cooper G.J., Rice P., Small fragment wounds: biophysics and pathophysiology, J Trauma, 40, 3 S, (1996); Owens B.D., Kragh J.F., Macaitis J., Svoboda S.J., Wenke J.C., Characterization of extremity wounds in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, J Orthop Trauma, 21, 4, pp. 254-257, (2007); Traverso L.W., Fleming A., Johnson D.E., Wongrukmitr B., Combat casualties in Northern Thailand: emphasis on land mine injuries and levels of amputation, Mil Med, 146, October, pp. 682-685, (1981); Kimmerle E., Baraybar J.P., Skeletal trauma: identification of injuries resulting from human rights Abuse and armed conflict, (2008); Christensen A.M., Smith V.A., Ramos V., Shegogue C., Whitworth M., Primary and secondary skeletal blast trauma, J Forensic Sci, 57, 1, pp. 6-11, (2012); Blanco-Pampin J., Suicidal deaths using fireworks, J Forensic Sci, 46, 2, pp. 402-405, (2001); Harding B.A., Wolf B.C., Independence day explosion on lovers key, J Forensic Sci, 52, 5, pp. 1186-1189, (2007); Lucas J., Fatalities associated with home-made pipe bombs in Northern Ireland, Am J Forensic Med Pathol, 29, 2, pp. 93-98, (2008); Tsokos M., Tark E.E., Madea B., Koops E., Longauer F., Szabo M., Et al., Pathologic features of suicidal deaths caused by explosives, Am J Forensic Med Pathol, 24, 1, pp. 55-63, (2003); Covey D.C., Blast and fragment injuries of the musculoskeletal system, J Bone Joint Surg Am, 84, 7, pp. 1221-1234, (2002); Covey D.C., Born C.T., Blast injuries: mechanics and wounding patterns, J Surg Orthop Adv, 19, 1, pp. 8-12, (2010); Agrewal J.P., Hodgson R.D., Organic chemistry of explosives, (2007); Cooper P.R., Kurowski S.R., Introduction to the technology of explosives, (1996); Cooper P.W., Explosives engineering, (1996); Meyer R., Kohler J., Homburg A., Explosives, (2007); Morgan B., Explosions and explosives, (1967); Zukas J.A., Walters W.P., Explosive effects and applications, (2003); DePalma R.G., Burris D.G., Champion H.R., Hodgson M.J., Blast injuries, N Engl J Med, 352, 13, pp. 1335-1342, (2005); Chaloner E., Blast injury in enclosed spaces, Br Med J, 331, pp. 119-120, (2005); Boffard K.D., MacFarlane C., Urban bomb blast injuries: patterns of injury and treatment, Surg Annu, 25, pp. 29-47, (1993); Mallonee S., Shariat S., Stennies G., Waxweiler R., Hogan D., Jordan F., Physical injuries and fatalities resulting from the Oklahoma City bombing, JAMA, 276, 5, pp. 382-387, (1996); Mellor S.G., The relationship of blast loading to death and injury from explosion, World J Surg, 16, 5, pp. 893-898, (1992); Ciraulo D.L., Frykberg E.R., The surgeon and acts of civilian terrorism: blast injuries, J Am Coll Surg, 203, 6, pp. 942-950, (2006); Haywood I., Skinner D., ABC of major trauma.

(DVI) in three settings: Québec, the United States, and the United Kingdom. In cases of multiple deaths, a series of actions accompanied by a plethora of tools are often invoked, housed at a disaster scene, forensic laboratories, a family assistance centre, and a mortuary. In this article, I examine a process dedicated to connecting the biological remains of the deceased with a confirmed validation of personhood. I describe a situation where responders/scientists will attempt multiple testing and re-testing of human remains, often pushing boundaries of available science. I argue that the search for certainty in identification lies at the heart of the activation of DVI processes, particularly when it is connected to DNA testing. Observing intimate forensic settings and the bricolage of the forensic anthropologist's labour has allowed me to track the production of the science of identity. I then reflect on the wider implications of these observations for affected communities and the responding scientists. Finally, I argue that there is complexity and ambivalence surrounding the increased use of technologies when applied to identification of victims. © 2023 The Authors.

I applied for and was awarded an urgent disaster research grant from the UK Economic and Social Research Council to allow this work to begin. ; Funding text 2: As DNA has grown in popularity as an identifier, obvious attention has turned to making it faster and more transportable to the disaster scene, at both mortuary and family assistance centres (see below). In the United States, this has evolved into the Rapid DNA programme. 15 Development of the technology has been actively supported and financed by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defence through a series of research and development grants over the last decade. Emphasis has been placed on both the speed of a profile result and the size/portability of the equipment. Final figures were not available on cost per profile at the time of the research, but it was described by contractors as considerably cheaper than a full laboratory-generated profile, which is the traditional approach to testing. Rapid DNA kits are available to crime laboratories as an alternative to a full DNA laboratory and are closely linked to ongoing governmental laboratory standardization work with grants available from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency to help procurement by local emergency planners. At the time of the observations that are at the core of this article, Rapid DNA was being trialled at numerous DVI exercises around the United States. The technology also has applications for kinship testing in border control settings (i.e. an airport, port, or other crossing station), on military deployments, and within police ?booking stations? when making arrests. Fellow participants in the US exercises were responders and evaluators, not just from the DVI setting, but from Department for Homeland Security border control and other law enforcement agencies. These participants were there to evaluate the potential for future use of the technology in gathering migrant DNA data in US detention centres; something that has now become practice (Silva 2019 ). This caused concern and disquiet about human rights infringements in exercise refreshment break times but was never overtly addressed in formal presentations.

However, post-conflict investigations challenge this current focus on standardisation due to the diversity of sociocultural contexts and a demand for culturally informed methodologies. Through a collaborative research project in northern Uganda, a team of anthropologists have addressed some of these issues in a context where spiritual disturbances associated with human remains from the recent war generate ongoing negative effects for Acholi survivors. Here, one facet of this longitudinal project is presented?forensic site surveys, their impact on collaboration with survivors, and their application to sociocultural, rather than traditional forensic, needs and international rights. The methodology presented here introduces a way to incorporate emic prerogatives by treating intangible effects of human remains as imperative to the medico-legal context and the site map. In conclusion, this methodology may offer a way to overcome western-centric human rights approaches while allowing local communities to further define what features are integral to the ?forensic? documentation process; tangible or intangible. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",documentation; Forensic human rights investigation; humanitarian methods; sitemaps; the intangible; Uganda,,,,,,"University of Findlay; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Wenner-Gren Foundation, WGF, (9075); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (T37MD001378); University of Tennessee, UT; American Academy of Forensic Sciences, AAFS","This work was supported by the University of Tennessee; the University of Findlay; the American Academy of Forensic Sciences Humanitarian and Human Rights Resource Center; the MHIRT Fellowship Program under Grant [NIH/NIMHD T37MD001378]; Wenner-Gren Foundation under Grant [9075].

However, there existed afterward a situation in which no retribution was made available for those who survived the turmoil, and likewise for the families of the victims, leaving a section of the Spanish population without access to means of a process of transitional justice. Investigations into the extrajudicial killings, and the recovery and identification of remains via the application of forensic anthropology did not come about until 2000, when a scientific approach to finding the disappeared was applied. Within the last decade and up to 2012, forensic anthropology has aided in the recovery of thousands of skeletal remains, albeit under difficult and far from ideal circumstances; the exhumation of a common grave located in Izagre, León province, and the subsequent attempt to identify the recovered victims will be presented as an example of the difficulties encountered. The exhumation and biological profiling of the victims has created a positive outcome within many families and some areas of society; nevertheless, at present, the dire economic situation of the country has caused the cessation of field or laboratory work. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.",Extrajudicial killings; Historical memory; Spanish Civil War,,,,,,,,"AI critica el ""vergonzoso"" rechazo de España a investigar las desapariciones en la guerra civil, (2013); España debe extraditar a los acusados de cometer torturas durante el franquismo, (2013); Aranzadi, (2013); Informe de la Exhumación de la Fosa Común de Izagre (León), (2008); (2013); Barragan D., Castro J., Arqueología de la justicia.

There are currently over 2000 known mass burial locations throughout Spain but many more are unknown. This study details the successful search for an unmarked mass grave in mountainous terrain in the Asturias region of Northern Spain. Two approximate locations were known due to eyewitness accounts. A phased site investigation approach was undertaken, which included Ground Penetrating Radar. Results showed a clear geophysical anomaly on 2D GPR profiles. The identified area was subsequently intrusively investigated by forensic archaeologists and human remains were successfully discovered. Careful and sensitive investigations are essential in these approaches where living relatives are involved. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Forensics; Geophysics; GPR; Mass graves; Spanish Civil War,"Archaeology; Burial; Forensic Sciences; History, 20th Century; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Radar; Software; Spain; Warfare; Article; cemetery; forensic anthropology; geographic and geological phenomena; geographic distribution; geology; geomorphology; Ground Penetrating Radar; human; image analysis; information processing; priority journal; war; archeology; burial; case report; forensic science; history; image processing; procedures; software; Spain; telecommunication; warfare",,,,,,,"Beevor A., The Spanish Civil War, (2002); Betancor E., Fregel R., Almeida M., Suarez N.M., Pestano J., DNA typing for the identification of eight victims of Spanish Civil War reprisals in the Canary Islands: the case of the Fuencaliente thirteen mass graves (Fuencaliente, La Palma), Forensic Sci.

Mass graves specifically are less well-known, reported, and addressed; they are located in municipal or state cemeteries which house unidentified bodies and of which there is no official census. An estimated 26,000 bodies are considered unidentified (SEGOB 2019a), and every year in Mexico City alone almost 500 bodies are sent to the mass graves in cemeteries. Comprehensive efforts in forensic science are required to mitigate the high percentage of unidentified bodies and coordinate the correct burial and registration of bodies in mass graves. The ongoing humanitarian crisis and the complexity of the context require that investigators look at overlaps between cases of disappeared persons and unidentified bodies, and between searches and identification. &copy; 2022 University of Florida Press. © 2022 Authors.",Forensic anthropology; Human rights; Mass grave; Mexico; Unidentified bodies,,,,,,,,"Almela RA., Términos y conceptos para el estudio de las prácticas funerarias en Arqueología, Revista Historia Autónoma, 1, pp. 13-20, (2012); Arteta I., Hay 26000 cuerpos sin identificar en México?

In fact, very few scientific articles have been published up to now, even if there is a considerable increase of terrorist attacks worldwide due to the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). In this paper, the authors show a retrospective autopsy-based study on the two major civilian terrorist events which occurred in Milan (Italy). The first one took place in a closed system, where a gelignite bomb was set inside the National Agriculture Bank in December 1969. 17 people were killed, and all of them underwent forensic autopsies, which were performed at the Milan Institute of Legal Medicine. The second event took place in an open system, where a car bomb exploded in Palestro Street in July 1993. 5 people were killed, forensic autopsies were performed as well. A total of 22 explosion-related deaths were assessed in this study. For each victim, the analysis of clothes, external and internal examinations were reported; furthermore, a statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test was carried out in order to show differences among blast injuries that occurred in a closed system versus an open system. The analysis of the autopsy reports, which included the descriptions of clothes, and the injury patterns allowed a possible reconstruction of the bodily exposure side of the victims in relation to the origin site of the explosive devices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Ballistics; Blast injury; Explosion-related death; Forensic anthropology; Mass disaster; Terrorism,cyclotetramethylene; gelignite; metal; nitrate fuel oil; octogen; semtex; tetranitramine; trinitrotoluene; unclassified drug; abdominal cavity; adult; ambient pressure; Article; autopsy; blast injury; bomb; bone deformation; clinical article; closed system; controlled study; contusion; diaphragm injury; explosion; female; fire fighter; flash burn; forensic evidence; forensic medicine; forensic science; human; improvised explosive device; internal examination; internal injury; intraparenchymal bleeding; laceration; lung injury; male; mechanical energy; mesenteric  bleeding; Milan; open system; pathologist; peak negative pressure; police; posterior fossa; retrospective study; skin abrasion; skin defect; skull fracture; subarachnoid hemorrhage; suffocation; terrorism; victim,,"trinitrotoluene, 118-96-7",,,,,"Artero-Guerrero J., Pernas-Sanchez J., Teixeira-Dias F., Blast wave dynamics: The influence of the shape of the explosive, J.

Absence of physical evidence, namely the presence of adequately identified corpses, may impede the full enjoyment of human rights and?in some cases?the course of justice as it obstructs the initiation of legal proceedings against individuals implicated in causing such catastrophes. It also presents administrative obstacles, as death certificates are indispensable in legitimizing statuses like orphanhood and widowhood. Family reunification, particularly for orphans, plays a significant role for those attempting to reconnect with their relatives all over the world. Likewise, for mothers, the acknowledgment of their marital status or widowhood can be a pathway to regain their marginalized right to social life. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed six representative cases from the tragic October 3, 2013, shipwreck near the Italian island of Lampedusa, where 366 individuals were retrieved dead from the sea. These cases underscore the practical challenges involved, highlighting the compelling need for continued efforts to ensure that this burdensome problem transcends from being a mere ethical, moral, and legal discourse. Although considerable progresses, these cases also reveal that substantial work still lies ahead. There is a pressing need for improved mechanisms to certify kinship ties, which are often the limiting factor in many reunifications, and can hinder the granting of custody to children. The severity and far-reaching implications of this problem necessitate thoughtful attention and action, especially considering the ongoing escalation in migration and related fatalities. © The Author(s) 2024.",Dead migrants; Family reunification; Human rights; Humanitarian forensic sciences; Identification,Child; Humans; child; human,,,,,"Università degli Studi di Milano, UniMi",Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Milano within the CRUI-CARE Agreement. ,"Cattaneo C., De Angelis D., Mazzarelli D., Porta D., Poppa P., Caccia G., D'Amico M.E., Siccardi C., Previdere C., Bertoglio B., Tidball-Binz M., Ubelaker D., Piscitelli V., Riccio S., The rights of migrants to the identification of their dead: an attempt at an identification strategy from Italy, Int J Legal Med, 137, pp. 145-156, (2023); Cattaneo C., Tidball Binz M., Penados L., Prieto J., Finegan O., Grandi M., The forgotten tragedy of unidentified dead in the Mediterranean, Forensic Sci Int, 250, pp. e1-e2, (2015); IOM (International Organization for Migration), (2017); Laczko F., Singleton A., Black J., Fatal Journey.

The present study aims to provide a detailed forensic analysis of the issues and implications arising in the event of an explosion. Methods: A retrospective review of casualty data was conducted on electronic literature databases. Cases concerning deadly explosions registered at the Milan Institute of Legal Medicine were examined and analyzed altogether. Results: Explosions may involve closed or open systems. A security assessment of the site is always necessary. Alterations of the site due to rescue procedures can occur; thus, on-site forensic investigation should be adapted to the environment. Then, a study protocol based on autopsy procedures is presented. Application of the postmortem radiology enforces forensic procedures both for the analysis of blast injuries and skeleton fractures, and for identification purposes. Blast injuries typically cause lacerations of the lungs, intestine and major vessels; moreover, hyoid fractures can be documented. Histopathology may help to define blast injuries effectively. Forensic chemistry, toxicology and ballistics provide useful investigative evidence as well as anthropology and genetics. Different forensic topics regarding explosions are discussed through five possible scenarios that forensic pathologists may come across. Scenarios include self-inflicted explosion deaths, domestic explosions, work-related explosions, terrorist events, and explosions caused by accidents involving heavy vehicles. Conclusion: The scenarios presented offer a useful instrument to avoid misinterpretations and evaluation errors. Procedural notes and technical aspects are provided to the readers, with an insight on collaboration with other forensic experts. © 2021, The Author(s).",Blast injury; Explosion-related death; Forensic anthropology; Mass disaster; Suicide; Terrorism,,,,,,"Università degli Studi di Milano, UniMi","Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Milano within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

Case presentation: A case of unknown skeletonized remains is reported in this investigation, which was found in a mass grave in Damascus Countryside governorate, Syria, in 2017. The post-mortem (PM) examination of bones and teeth was completed in al-Muwasat University Hospital in Damascus. Skull and pelvic bones showed Caucasoid male traits: the fourth rib and teeth examination estimated the age to be between 30 and 40 years, and the long bone estimated the stature in centimeters to be between 172 and 179. Intact dentition with tiny fracture in the incisal edge of the upper right central incisor?along with pathological fracture of right patella?was noted. Matching with ante-mortem (AM) smile photograph and radiograph of the right knee led to positive identification. Conclusions: The present study highlights the importance of maintaining and storage of medical radiographs or any other records that show the teeth or bones of the person. © 2020, The Author(s).",Forensic anthropology; Forensic radiology; Human remains; Identification,,,,,,,,"Burns K.R., Forensic anthropology training manual, (2013); DiMaio V.J.M., Gunshot wounds: practical aspects of firearms, ballistics, and forensic techniques, (1999); Dumaneiae J., Kaiae Z., Njemirovskij V., Brkiae H., Zeeeviae D., Dental identification after two mass disasters in Croatia, Croat Med J, 42, 6, pp. 657-662, (2001); Fierro G., Calvino G., Sasso F., Congenital double patella.

Others have contextualised these decedents?many of whom likely belonged to socially, politically, and/or economically marginalised groups in life?as part of a larger identification crisis in the US. However, there has been little discussion surrounding how this humanitarian crisis has manifested in academic institutions, where anthropologists often provide medicolegal consultation and act as long-term stewards of the unidentified. The Identification & Repatriation Initiative was created at the Forensic Anthropology Centre at Texas State University (FACTS) to recognise and investigate unidentified human remains in long-term storage. Our paper outlines common challenges that were encountered during our initial reassessment of unidentified cases at FACTS, emphasising the detrimental impacts of inconsistent procedures, loss of context, and case fatigue. It is likely that other academic institutions face similar challenges, and by highlighting these issues we hope to help initiate a larger conversation concerning ethical stewardship of human remains in these settings. By incorporating humanitarian perspectives into forensic casework, anthropologists in academia can better advocate for the long-term unidentified.Key points Forensic anthropologists at academic institutions are qualified to act as consultants on forensic casework when requested by jurisdictional authorities and are often responsible for the long-term management of unidentified human remains. The long-term unidentified represent a vulnerable population and academic institutions are not exempt from calls for humanitarian approaches to identification. The Identification and Repatriation Initiative was created at the Forensic Anthropology Centre at Texas State University to acknowledge and investigate unidentified human remains in long-term storage. This paper considers possible ways for humanitarian action to be incorporated into academic settings and suggests anthropologists can better advocate for the unidentified through procedural standardisation, institutional and interagency collaboration and ethical stewardship. © 2022 The Author(s).

Most of the recovered more than 9600 bodies have tended to be from the Republican civil population, the majority having been executed extrajudicially. However, a number of exhumations relate to the remains of soldiers who died in combat. In fact, approximately 100 individual or mass graves have been investigated and exhumed, containing the remains of combatants. These burials tend to be in the same location where they fell, usually in the front line, or close to the field hospitals where they went after being wounded initially. During the recovery of the human remains, a number of artefacts related to the uniform as well as personal effects have been found. An interdisciplinary approach from archaeology, anthropology, genetics, history and other disciplines has enabled the identification of some of these combatants. The aim of this paper is to present the data obtained from these combatants and highlight the work undertaken in Spain, and the efforts by scientists to exhume, identify and return the remains to relatives where possible. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Combatants; Forensic anthropology; Forensic archaeology; Human remains; Mass graves; Spanish Civil War,"Archaeology; Burial; Exhumation; Forensic Anthropology; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Military Personnel; Spain; Warfare; archeology; article; artifact; burial; field hospital; forensic anthropology; human; relative; Spain; archeology; exhumation; forensic anthropology; history; male; military personnel; procedures; warfare",,,,,"Instituto de la Memoria, de la Convivencia y los Derechos Humanos del País Vasco; Society for Church Archaeology, SCA","This paper is the result of the work undertaken by all the Anthropology team members of SCA, as well as the surveying work undertaken by Euskal Prospektore Taldea.

Analysis of the trauma sustained and the anthropologic profile of both the victims and the perpetrators elucidates the trends and contrasts them with the phenomenon in the past. Objectives: The purpose of the forensic investigation of mass casualty incidents is manifold: establishing the minimal number of individuals involved, identifying the victims and perpetrators, collecting material evidence, and determining the modus operandi. Methods: The postmortem examination includes external description of the bodies and their injuries, photo-documentation, and sampling of tissues. Radiography, dental examination, and a ten-print card of each cadaver are also recorded. Results: The modus operandi of the current Intifada is somewhat different from that of the previous wave of terrorism and includes more road shootings and vehicular terrorism. In addition, three suicide bombers who detonated explosive devices within crowded areas were young women, and the age of the perpetrators has increased from up to 35 years to individuals as old as 47, thus greatly enlarging the potential number of suicide terrorists. Virologic and biologic tests have been introduced to examine the tissues of the suicide bombers since they are possible sources of contagion to the wounded victims. Conclusion: The results of the medico-legal investigation of victims and perpetrators of terrorism enable us to establish the modus operandi and the profile of potential perpetrators, which can help in the prevention of similar attacks. Documentation of the different types of injuries in fatal victims of explosion and shooting contributes to improving the awareness of the medical staff treating the wounded of similar attacks. Further investigation into the reliability of virologic and biologic tests conducted on postmortem tissue is recommended.",Forensic sciences; Identification; Intifada; Suicide bombing; Terrorism,Adult; Arabs; Blast Injuries; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Israel; Middle Aged; Terrorism; War; Explosives; Radiography; Tissue; accident; article; autopsy; communicable disease; destruction; disaster; document examination; evidence based medicine; explosion; fatality; forensic identification; forensic medicine; gunshot injury; human; Israel; major clinical study; medicolegal aspect; Palestine; sampling; suicide; terrorism; traffic accident; victim; virology; wound infection; Virology; Medicine,,,,,,,"Kahana T., Freund M., Hiss J., Suicidal terrorist bombing in Israel - Identification of human remains, J Forensic Sci, 42, pp. 260-264, (1997); Fierro M., Identification of human remains, Medicolegal Investigation of Death.

The modus operandi of the perpetrators was detonating, in a public area, an explosive device carried on or in close proximity to the terrorist's body. We reviewed the postmortem examinations and identification procedures performed by the medical and law enforcement personnel involved in mass disaster management. The types of injuries sustained by the victims and perpetrators include body disruption, explosive injuries, flying missile injuries, and blast injuries. Blunt trauma directly produced by the explosion and flying missile injuries account for 80.1% of the wounds. The number of fatalities was more closely related to the type of the attack rather than to the amount and type of explosives used. Swift identification of all victims and perpetrators was obtained through collaboration between the different professional teams involved: forensic scientists, law enforcement agencies, and secret service investigators. Based on the analysis of the data obtained from the necroscopic examinations, we observed that most of the wounds sustained fall within the realm of blunt force injuries; emergency medical facilities that might be faced with similar situations should prepare accordingly. Collaboration between the various forensic and law enforcement teams results in swift resolution of disaster management.

The boat sank quickly after the collision just in the middle of the Otranto Canal (Mediterranean Sea). Only 34 individuals survived the accident; 58 died, mostly women and children, and dozens were missing. After 7 months spent at depth of 800 m approximately underwater to constant temperature of 4 C, the motorboat was rescued, and totally, 52 bodies were recovered from the holds. The management of the mass disaster is summarized focusing on the procedures applied in the recovery of the boat and victims, and the identification process. The purpose of the article is to present the unique taphonomic model of decomposition dealing with marine sequestered environments. The postmortem changes have been revised according with a skeletonization scoring system. Surprisingly, most of the victims were in good condition with soft tissues still present except at the head/neck region and the hands resulting in the body parts mostly pre-skeletonized. Closed compartments as well as heavy clothing in multiple layers protected the bodies from animal activity of marine scavengers. Presumptive positive identification was obtained in 49 out of 52 bodies based on the correspondence between ante- and postmortem data. An additional purpose of the article is also to focus on the practice of coercive actions disproportionate to the risk of unauthorized entry criticized by several international organizations for migration and recently condemned by the European Court in Strasbourg. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Human rights; Identification; Marine taphonomy; Mass disaster; Postmortem interval,Accidents; Adolescent; Adult; Age Determination by Skeleton; Age Determination by Teeth; Albania; Animals; Decapoda (Crustacea); Disasters; Drowning; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fishes; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Pathology; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Mollusca; Oceans and Seas; Postmortem Changes; Refugees; Ships; Transients and Migrants; Young Adult; accident; adolescent; adult; age determination; Albania; animal; article; case report; Decapoda (Crustacea); disaster; drowning; feeding behavior; female; fish; forensic pathology; human; Italy; male; middle aged; migration; mollusc; pathology; physical anthropology; postmortem change; refugee; sea; ship; young adult; drowning; pathology,,,,,"Italian Committee for Refugees; United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR","The Kater Radez I relict has been recently turned into a special work of art to be placed in Otranto City.

Experts of this field (usually a branch of forensic medicine) routinely are solving ""technical"" questions of crime investigation, particularly identification of (usually dead) individuals. Practical implementation of the mission of forensic anthropology is not an easy task due to interdisciplinary character of the field. On one hand, physical anthropology has in its disposition numerous scientifically tested methods, however, their practical value in particular legal processes is limited. Reasons for these discrepancies can be related both to insufficient understanding of possibilities and limitations of forensic anthropology and archaeology by officials representing legal institutions that perform investigations, and sometimes too ""academic"" research, that is conducted at anthropological laboratories, when methods developed are not completely relevant to practical needs. Besides of answering to direct questions (number of individuals, sex, age, stature, population affinity, individual traits, evidence of violence), important humanitarian aspects - the individual's right for identity, the right of the relatives to know the fate of their beloved ones should not be neglected. Practical use of other identification methods faces difficulties of their own (e.g. odontology - lack of regular dental registration system and compatible database). Two examples of forensic anthropological work of mass graves, even when the results were much influenced by the questions raised by investigators, can serve as an illustration of the above-mentioned issues. © 2009 E.

Thus, the goal of the research was to determine the trauma type and probable cause of death on skeletal remains of civilians executed by partisans from WWS found in the three karst sinkholes and to explain the context in which the injuries occurred. We determined biological profiles, pathological conditions, traumas, and assessed their lethality. Nineteen skeletons were found, 68.4% had, at least, one perimortem trauma, classified as lethal/lethal if untreated in 69.2% cases. The type of execution and administered violence showed to be age and health dependent: elderly and diseased were executed with the intention to kill, by the gunshot facing victims, whilst the more violent behavior expressed towards younger and healthy individuals was indicated by the higher frequency of blunt force trauma. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine",Croatia; Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Legal medicine; Skeletal trauma; WWS,"Adolescent; Adult; Body Remains; Bone and Bones; Croatia; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; War Crimes; World War II; Wounds, Gunshot; Wounds, Nonpenetrating; Young Adult; adult; Article; biological activity; blunt trauma; Croatia; female; forensic anthropology; forensic pathology; gunshot injury; human; human tissue; injury; lethality; male; skeleton; violence; war; adolescent; body remains; bone; injuries; middle aged; pathology; war; war crime; young adult",,,,,,,"Iscan M.Y., Steyn M., The Human Skeleton in Forensic Medicine, (2013); White T.D., Black M.T., Folkens P.A., Human Osteology, (2011); Buikstra J.E., Ubelaker D.H., Standards for data collection from human skeletal remains, Arkansas archaeological Survey Research Series.

Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine, Israel","Positive identification of human remains is one of the most important tasks in mass disaster investigations. Religious and jurisdictional demands in Israel, require the identification process to be completed in the shortest possible time. In the 18 suicidal terrorist bombings that took place in Israel between the years 1993 1996, 127 victims and 19 perpetrators were killed, and their severely fragmented bodies were identified within 24 h. The efficient completion of the identification endeavor was enabled by the implementation of a variety of techniques and the close collaboration in the investigation between the different emergency and forensic agencies. This paper presents the mass disaster identification policy and techniques currently used in Israel. The importance of an interdisciplinary approach for the identification of extremely fragmented human remains from mass disasters and the creation of a central data bank of fingerprints and genetic markers is emphasized.",forensic science; identification of human remains; mass disaster management policy; suicidal bombing,article; cadaver; disaster; forensic identification; genetic marker; human; Israel; offender; priority journal; suicide; victim,,,,,,,"Fierro M.F., Identification of human remains, In: Spitz VU, Editor.

The Israel National Police, the Israel Defense Forces, and the L. Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine's experts examined 171 victims who died in 21 incidents of suicidal terrorism. The trauma sustained by the victims and perpetrators of suicidal bombings included complete body disruption and explosive, flying missile, and blast injuries. The modus operandi of the perpetrators, reconstructed from the distribution and type of injury of the victims, is discussed. Fifty-five victims perished in open space bombings and 91 inside buses. All perpetrators of these bombings died at the time of the incident regardless of their location. Identification of the victims was achieved using fingerprints, dental records, medical intervention signs, anatomic variation, genetic profile, and personal recognition. Prompt identification of the perpetrators allowed speedy apprehension of the accomplices and prevention of similar attacks.

The authors present several case studies from the former Yugoslavia illustrating community-based interventions combining education projects and participation in antemortem data collection as well as providing a support network for families of the missing. The participation of the scientific investigators (pathologists, anthropologists, crime scene investigators, etc), many of whom are unprepared for the presence of family members at the scene, is critical to the success of the integrated process.

It is a phenomenon that can cause damage to life and property and destroy the economic, social and cultural life of the people; and overwhelms the capacity of the community to cope with the event. The recent tragic aviation accidents in 2014 involving Malaysia Airlines flights MH370 and MH17 shocked the world in an unprecedented manner. This paper focuses on the Malaysian experience in the MH17 mission in Ukraine as well as the first ever international Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) operation for the Malaysian DVI team. The DVI operations in Hilversum, the Netherlands were well described in stages. The Netherlands? Landelijk Team Forensische Opsporing as the lead DVI team in Hilversum operated systematically, ensuring the success of the whole mission. This paper discusses the lessons learned by the Malaysian team on proper DVI structure, inter- and intra-agency cooperation, facilities planning and set up, logistics and health and safety aspects, as well as effective communication and collaboration with other international delegates. Several issues and challenges faced by the Malaysian team were also documented.

In fact, management of unidentified or unknown bodies is also a vital component of the day-to-day mortuary work practice. The unidentified and subsequently unclaimed bodies have always been a ?silent mass disaster,? a problem that needs to be tackled within the forensic community and raises the global issue of ethics, law, and human rights. Unidentified bodies? in Malaysia make up an average of 4.02% of all death cases where a total postmortem examination was performed which is comparable with other developing countries within 4?10% which can go up to 25%. Moreover, unstandardized procedures in all mortuaries in different states and districts in Malaysia have worsened the scenario even with guidelines in place. This study aims to address the issues surrounding unidentified and unclaimed bodies including body disposal from a social and legal perspective using case study methodology by comparing four different countries in the Asia Pacific Region through document analysis and interview methods. One of the major findings is evident in 3 out of the 4 models, whereby there is a considerable gap in consolidating the missing person report and information to match with the unidentified bodies received in forensic institutions in an attempt to enhance the identification process which ultimately intends as a closure for the family members. It is also timely to think out of the box beyond dental records and DNA profiling to improve the identification rate for skeletonized remains through means of anthropology biometrics comparison. With the limited literature published surrounding this domain, it is hoped that the suggestions and recommendations to standardize the management of unidentified and unclaimed bodies can benefit many forensic institutions and public mortuaries in this region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science???

For forensic anthropologists attempting to engage in grassroots forensic intervention, unaffiliated with an international investigation, means for effectively accessing and engaging communities has not been widely discussed. Here, forensic anthropologists draw on multiple, cross-cultural contexts to discuss methods and techniques for introducing forensic partnerships to communities. To do this, the scientist must consider their positionality as well as that of the stakeholders, develop effective local relationships, and consider a community-grounded approach. This paper argues that drawing on broader cultural anthropological training, ultimately informs one?s ability to gain entry into at-risk and vulnerable communities while minimizing harm. To illustrate this point, examples are drawn from Canada, Uganda, Cyprus, and Somaliland. © 2021 The Author(s).

Whether for medico-legal intervention and acquisition of evidence or humanitarian repatriation and identification of human remains, forensic expertise has garnered attention in the global arena. Arguably fulfilling evidentiary and psychosocial needs, there has been growing interest in this post-conflict redress. However, as part of the critique of these interventions, scholars and practitioners have pointed out ? primarily in medico-legal investigations ? a lack of sensitization of local communities regarding forensic work, increasing the potential for re-traumatization, unrealistic expectations, or an unintentional increase in political tensions. Research regarding forensic intervention and human remains have permeated social sciences, peace and conflict studies, and science and technology studies, revealing both intentional and unintentional impacts of forensic sciences after mass violence. In an effort to mitigate negative impacts of medico-legal or humanitarian interventions, the research described here sought to sensitize communities in Uganda about forensic methods.

Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys) in Marianna, Florida. The school closed following a century of controversy regarding abuse, malfeasance, and allegations of murder; prior to closure, the school was subjected to repeated State and Federal investigations. Through the course of this investigation (2011-current), 55 unmarked burials were located and excavated for identification and repatriation using a range of forensic anthropology field and laboratory methods. In 2014, the first child victim was positively identified. This event occurred 100 years after the first reported death at the school and more than 70 years after George Owen Smith went missing. The identity of the decedents, and circumstances surrounding their deaths are established based on archival research forensic interviews, skeletal analysis, and DNA comparisons. These analytical tools are establishing patterns among those who died at the school, which include a disproportionate amount of African American deaths, a high number of runaway deaths, and a high prevalence of death due to infectious disease and illness, likely resulting from the practices and policies of the institution. The historical significance of human and civil rights violations in Florida in the area of juvenile justice and the rights of families to have accountability and transparency, decades after the deaths occurred, are discussed. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.",Civil rights; Dozier School for Boys; Florida Industrial School; Forensic anthropology; Human identification; Missing children,,,,,,,,"Attorney General's Fourth Annual Report to Congress, Pursuant to the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007, (2012); Ashworth A., Responsibilities, Rights and Restorative Justice, British Journal of Criminology, 42, 3, pp. 578-595, (2002); Braithwaite J., Restorative Justice: Assessing Optimistic and Pessimistic Accounts, Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, 25, pp. 1-110, (1999); Investigation of the Arthur G.

In 1984-85, forensic scientists from the United States, working under the auspices of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, exhumed skeletal remains of disappeared persons in Argentina. They provided physical evidence for the trial of members of the deposed military junta and trained an Argentine forensic anthropology team. It became apparent that medical and forensic verification of torture and extrajudicial executions could provide irrefutable evidence that such activities had, in fact, taken place. Requests for assistance came from human rights groups throughout the world, and led to the development of an international protocol for the investigation of government sponsored murders. The United States based Physicians for Human Rights has now conducted missions to nearly 30 countries. The recent documentation of mass graves in El Salvador, Guatemala, Iraqi Kurdistan and the former Yugoslavia demonstrates how forensic scientists expose such crimes to international scrutiny, and the necessity of scientific evidence when confronting human rights violations.",,article; death; forensic identification; human rights,,,,,,,,,,Yozmot Heiliger Ltd,,,,,,7231393,,MELAD,7845175,English,MED.

He was found guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. One part of the judgment was concerned with the Srebrenica events in which much forensic evidence from mass graves featured. Whilst this was to be expected, forensic evidence from the horrific crime scenes continues to be important in determining aspects of the crime base. This paper discusses the evidence and examines how the Chamber came to the conclusion that systematic killing of thousands of Bosnian Muslim men occurred and attempts had been made to conceal the crimes and human remains in secondary graves thus confirming the actus reus of genocide. In particular, the number of people killed was at issue. Despite the absence of compelling counter-theories on behalf of the accused, this paper demonstrates that contestations over the number of those killed remain and predicts that this is unlikely to change for the ongoing Mladic case. © 2016",Expert evidence; Forensic evidence; International criminal court; International criminal proceedings; International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; Mass graves,Bosnia and Herzegovina; Burial; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; War Crimes; court; crime; genocide; human; legal evidence; Muslim; Yugoslavia; Bosnia and Herzegovina; burial; forensic anthropology; legislation and jurisprudence; war crime,,,,,,,"(2016); Delauney G., Mixed Reaction to Radovan Karadzic Verdict in Bosnia, (2016); Toe R., Bosnian Media Split Over Karadzic Verdict, (2016); Hodzic R., Post-Karadzic Bosnia and Herzegovina: the End of the Criminal Justice Era, (2016); Kostovicova D., The Karadzic Verdict: How the Trial Played Out and What It Means for BOSNIA, (2016); Jacobs D., (2016); Jacobs D., (2016); UN SC, Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (as amended on 17 May 2002), (1993); (2007); Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Vol. II, Part Two UN Doc A/CN.4/SER.A/1996/Add.l, p. 45, para 8 of the Commentary to Article, 17, (1996); Prosecutor v Krstic, Appeals Chamber Judgment, IT-98-33-A, (2004); Klarin M., The Tribunal's four battles, Journal of International Criminal Justice, 2, 2, pp. 546-557, (2004); International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Trial Judgment Summary for Radovan Karad?ic, (2016); Prosecutor v Popovic, Et al., Decision on Defence Rule 94 bis Notice Regarding Prosecution Expert Witness Richard Butler, IT-05-88-T, (2007); Rohde D., Endgame: The Betrayal and Fall of Srebrenica, Europe's Worst Massacre since World War II, (2012); Silber L., Little A., The Death of Yugoslavia, (1996); Stover E., Peress G., The Graves, pp. 319-328, (1998); Prosecutor v Krstic, Appeals Chamber Judgment, IT-98-33-A, (2004); Prosecutor v Milosevic, Witness Statement by Investigations Team Leader Dean Paul Manning, (2003); (2003); (2016); Prosecutor v Blagojevic and Jokic, Decision on Prosecution's Motion for Admission of Expert Statements, IT-0260-T, (2003); (2000); Prosecutor v Milosevic, Decision on Admissibility of Prosecution Investigator's Evidence, IT-02-54-AR73.2, (2002); (2012); Prosecutor v Karadzic, Decision on Accused's Request for Assistance of Defense Experts in the Courtroom During Testimony of Seven Prosecution Expert Witnesses, IT-95-5/18-T, (2011); Prosecutor v Karadzic, Decision on Accused's Request for Assistance of Defense Experts in the Courtroom During Testimony of Seven Prosecution Expert Witnesses, IT-95-5/18-T, (2011); Klinkner M., Proving Genocide?

CMP archaeologists investigated 217 coastal locations and recovered skeletal remains on 44 occasions. Challenging environmental conditions required a customized exhumation plan, which could be executed swiftly without compromising operational integrity or standards. The author performed a retrospective analysis to propose an optimized strategy, which includes a survey, exhumation, digital documentation, and post-processing components, with the aim of minimizing the effects of adverse environmental conditions. The proposed strategy is based on scientific standards and observations in the field; it can satisfy the needs of a humanitarian or criminal investigation if appropriate measures are taken to uphold legislative and forensic standards. The author also discussed the taphonomic effects of coastal erosion and wave activity in tandem with exhumation recommendations to assist forensic practitioners involved in similar investigations. © 2023 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences",Aquatic environment; Clandestine burial; Coastal exhumation; Forensic archaeology; Missing persons; Taphonomy,archeology; Article; body remains; coastal waters; Cyprus; documentation; environmental factor; exhumation; human; questionnaire; retrospective study; social worker; taphonomy,,,,,,,"(1975); (1977); (2021); (1981); Ktori M., Baranhan G., Development and future perspectives of a humanitarian forensic programme: the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus example, Egypt J.

Within 48. h a temporary body storage facility was constructed adjacent to the existing mortuary. This temporary facility had the capacity to store up to 300 deceased persons. Pathologists, anthropologists, odontologists, police and mortuary assistants responded from all around Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. The existing forensic mortuary and staff were divided into two areas: DVI (disaster victim identification) and ""routine operations"" A high priority for the mortuary was to ensure the casework of the ""routine"" deceased persons (those cases which were not related to the bushfires) was handled concurrently and in a timely manner. On admission each set of victim remains was given both a Coroner's case number in addition to the DVI number allocated at the scene. The case was CT scanned, examined by a pathologist, an anthropologist, and odontologist and in some instances a fingerprint expert. Where possible a DNA sample was taken. All processes, samples, labels and paperwork underwent a quality assurance check prior to the case completion. Regular audits were conducted. All of post mortem examinations were completed within 20 days of admission. Occupational health and safety issues of the staff were a high priority; this included correct manual handling, infection control and psychological debriefings. During the operation it was found that some remains were contaminated with asbestos. Procedures were set in place to manage these cases individually and each was isolated to reduce the risk of exposure by staff to asbestos. This overall mortuary operation identified a number of significant challenges, in particular the management of multiple parts of human remains for one individual. A new procedure was developed to ensure that all human remains, where possible, were reconciled with identified deceased persons prior to the release to the funeral director. It also highlighted the need to have well documented plans in place including plans for temporary mortuary facilities. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Bushfire; Disaster victim identification; Mortuary management,asbestos; DNA; article; Australia; autopsy; bushfire; contamination; coroner; dentistry; disaster planning; DNA fingerprinting; emergency care; forensic identification; forensic medicine; forensic pathology; human; image analysis; Indonesia; infection control; laboratory diagnosis; medical audit; multidetector computed tomography; natural disaster; New Zealand; occupational exposure; occupational health; occupational safety; physical anthropology; police; posthumous care; priority journal; psychosocial care; quality control; risk reduction; victim,,"asbestos, 1332-21-4; DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,,"Prieto J.L., Tortosa C., Bedate A., Segura L., Abenza J.M., Mariscal de Gante M.C., Conejero J., Magana C., Perea B., The 11 March 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks: the importance of the mortuary organisation for identification of victims.

With over 30,000 still unrecovered from past conflicts including World War One (WW1) and World War Two (WWII), the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force have teams that research, recover, identify and oversee the burial (or reburial) of the remains of soldiers and airmen who continue to be found each year. The Royal Australian Navy is also responsible for its unrecovered casualties. Collectively the priorities of the various services within the ADF are the respectful recovery and treatment of the dead, thorough forensic identification efforts, resolution for families and honouring the ADF's proud history of service and sacrifice. What is unique about the approach of the ADF is that the respective services retain responsibility for their historic losses, while a joint approach is taken on policies and in the utilisation of the pool of forensic specialists. Section One describes the process undertaken by the Australian Army in the recovery, identification and burial or repatriation of soldiers through its specialised unit Unrecovered War Casualties - Army (UWC-A). Section Two describes the role of the Royal Australian Air Force in the recovery of aircraft and service personnel through their specialised unit Historic Unrecovered War Casualties ?

In case of air crashes or explosions, DVI units may face thousands of fragmented human remains (FHRs). The physical re-association of FHRs and the identification process is very complex and challenging, and relies upon expensive and destructive DNA analysis. A virtual re-association (VRA) of these fragments, using Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT), could be a helpful tool in forensic anthropology analysis, as it could assist in reducing the number of DNA samples. However, there is no standardized protocol for including such an approach into a DVI procedure. The aim of this study was to summarize and analyze existing techniques through a systematic review and to develop a protocol for virtual re-association of FHRs, adapted to the DVI context. A keyword-based literature search was conducted, focusing on the VRA methods using MDCT imaging and 3D surface scan methodology. Reviews and primary articles, published between 2005 and 2020 in the fields of forensic anthropology, paleoanthropology, archeology, and fracture reduction surgery were sorted out. A total of 45 publications were selected and analyzed based on their content and relevance. The results show that research on the re-association of FHRs increased significantly during the last five years. Seven steps regarding the MDCT-based method for the virtual re-association of FHRs could be identified: acquisition of 3D-images, segmentation of the MDCT-data, post-processing and surface generation, identification of intact and fracture surfaces, identification and registration of matching fragments, and validation of the re-association. The literature is surprisingly sparse regarding the FHRs re-association as a forensic tool, and mainly consists in case reports, whereas validated methods were presented in archeology and surgery publications. However, we were able to adapt the MDCT-based approach for the virtual re-association of the FHRs and propose an innovative protocol for DVI missions. This protocol includes the needed details, from the acquisition of MDCT imaging to the virtual re-association of 3D models and its validation. Each step has to be fully tested, adapted and validated in future studies. © 2021",3D images; Computed tomography; Forensic anthropology; Fragmented Human Remains; Re-association,Body Remains; Disaster Victims; DNA; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Medicine; Humans; DNA; archeology; disaster victim; forensic anthropology; fracture reduction; human; human experiment; multidetector computed tomography; paleoanthropology; review; systematic review; body remains; disaster victim; forensic anthropology; forensic medicine,,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, ",,,University Center of Legal Medicine Lausanne-Geneva; University Centre of Legal Medicine Lausanne-Geneva,"We would like to thank Alejandro Dominguez, Christine Bruguier, André Guerra, Ruben Soto, radiographers at the University Center of Legal Medicine Lausanne-Geneva for supplying technical help.

It will briefly summarise its historical establishment, making comparative reference to other regions?particularly the United Kingdom and United States, and the influence of the Bali Bombings of 2002, Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami of 2004 and Black Saturday Bushfires of 2009. The analysis goes on to consider key factors in research in forensic anthropology in the United States, and the development of standards and regulation in the US and UK. The significance of research in post-mortem diagenesis in Brazil?a country sharing aspects of climate, soil types and demography with Australia?is also considered, as well as the significance of patterns of casework encountered in Australia compared with those of other jurisdictions. While forensic anthropology as a discipline has grown remarkably in recent years, this analysis suggests that research and training tailored to the specific pattern of casework encountered in Australia is now essential to support the development of national standards in science, education, and professional regulation. The significance of the establishment of the first taphonomy research facility outside of the US?the Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research?is briefly considered with reference to what this facility may offer to the development of forensic anthropology in Australia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Forensic anthropology; Forensic Anthropology Population Data; Forensic human identification; Forensic science; Human decomposition; Taphonomy; Time since death interval,Australia; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Internationality; Article; Australia; Brazil; climate; demography; diagenesis; earthquake; fire; forensic anthropology; postmortem change; priority journal; qualitative analysis; soil; standardization; taphonomy; terrorism; tsunami; United Kingdom; United States; education; forensic anthropology; human; international cooperation; organization and management; trends,,,,,,,"Evison M.P., Forensic anthropology and human identification from the Skeleton, Handbook of Forensic Science, pp. 84-112, (2009); Byers S.N., Introduction to Forensic Anthropology, (2010); Ubelaker D.H., Introduction to forensic anthropology, Forensic Anthropology and Medicine: Complementary Scienes from Recovery to Cause of Death, pp. 3-12, (2006); Randolph-Quinney P., Mallett X., Black S.M., Forensic anthropology, Wiley Encylopedia of Forensic Science, pp. 152-178, (2009); Mallett X., Sutisno M., Anthropology: an overview, Encyclopedia of Forensic and Legal Medicine, pp. 196-206, (2016); Gulec E.S., Iscan M.Y., Forensic anthropology in Turkey, Forensic Sci.

The challenges faced as well as its potential have grown in synergy with other areas in forensic science. In academia, as well as in practice, the discipline has seen much specialisation in different areas. In particular in recent years, the importance of the forensic anthropologist has led to an increase volume of casework for these scientists, and an important role in disaster victim identification worldwide. This paper sees the need for a revised definition which reflects the nature of the work, both with the living as well as with the dead, in individual domestic cases or international human rights? investigations. A review of the work undertaken by forensic anthropologists is provided with special emphasis on mass fatality incidents. This paper also explores the discipline?s contribution to DNA analysis and positive identification. It is important to highlight the forensic anthropologists? role and their potential in any deployment of a National or International Disaster Victim Identification team. © 2021 Sociedad Anatomica Espanola.

This process was called ?concentration?. When found, these graves were exhumed, the bodies within were examined to try and establish or confirm identification, and were subsequently reburied in newly built. Imperial War Grave Commission cemeteries. This task was carried out by military staff working for the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries. They had no forensic or medical experience and yet in less than three years they moved hundreds of thousands of graves, on a scale never seen before or since. Written records were issued for the soldiers working on exhumation in 1919 giving detailed instructions on how to search for buried or unburied individuals, the method to follow for excavating these graves and directions for the examination of bodies. These instructions are very similar to those used in modern forensic archaeology when excavating single or mass graves, or when dealing with multiple bodies following mass disasters. They show an awareness of the effects of human burials on the surrounding environment and address search and excavation problems that are still experienced. The example given here in France and Belgium is one of the earliest examples of Forensic Archaeology for humanitarian purposes, and the instructions issued are probably the earliest written instructions for a Forensic Archaeological excavation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Exhumation; First World War; Forensic archaeology; Grave concentration; Ground search,"Archaeology; Body Remains; Burial; Cemeteries; Documentation; Europe; Exhumation; Forensic Anthropology; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Personnel; Postmortem Changes; World War I; adult; archeology; article; awareness; Belgium; cemetery; exhumation; France; human; mass disaster; military personnel; archeology; body remains; burial; documentation; Europe; exhumation; forensic anthropology; history; postmortem change; war",,,,,,,"Hunter J., Cox M., Forensic Archaeology: Advances in Theory and Practice, (2005); Groen W.J.M., Marquez-Grant N., Janaway R.C., Concluding remarks, Forensic Archaeology: a Global Perspective, pp. 515-536, (2015); Haglund W.D., Recent mass graves, an introduction, Advances in Forensic Taphonomy, pp. 243-262, (2002); Haglund W.D., Connor M., Scott D.D., The archaeology of contemporary mass graves, Hist.

Despite having positive social economic indicators, it still faces multiple challenges regarding forensic practices for personal identification. The objective of this paper is to discuss the recent advances and current challenges in the region, from the perspectives of anthropological and dental postmortem human identification, missing persons, and disaster victim identification (DVI) from 2019 to 2021. The recent creation of a Forensic Anthropology Sector (SAF) in the state?s official forensic institution (Polícia Científica?PCI) has significantly improved identification of unidentified remains and optimised resources available for DNA analysis. However, SAF is still quite understaffed, which negatively affects the recovery of skeletal material, its preparation, and the time needed for filing reports. Santa Catarina has passed legislation for missing persons in 2015, 4 years prior to the sanction of federal laws implementing the national policy for the disappeared. Nonetheless, a lack of integration between stakeholders remains a problem that PCI has tried to circumvent with the Conecta Programme, a multidisciplinary and integrated initiative between families of the missing persons, police agencies, and the Public Ministry. The programme aims to collect not only reference DNA samples, but also relevant anthropological and dental data. It also offers facial progression services in cases of disappearances that occurred many years ago. Despite a history of disasters in the state, PCI still needs to implement international DVI standards at an institutional level. Recent training on Phase 1 DVI procedures, integrated with other responding institutions, indicates better preparation for future disasters. There are many challenges ahead for Santa Catarina?s forensic institution and professionals that have yet to be addressed, but the overall situation on routine personal identification, missing persons initiatives, and DVI has improved over the last 2 years. © 2023 The Author(s).

The Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus began a program of exhumations in 2005, through which more than 185 burial sites pertaining to the two periods of conflict have been identified and excavated. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to present a classification of the main types of clandestine burial and (ii) to test the hypothesis that the nature of conflict influences the mode of interment. Burials can be divided into ""public burials"" and ""concealed burials,"" based on the possible motives of those involved in the interment and then subdivided into smaller categories based on similarities in archeological context. A comparison of results from the two periods of conflict reveals that there are statistical differences (p < 0.005), which indicate that the mode of interment may reflect the nature, character, and atmosphere of conflict. © 2014 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Clandestine burial; Classification; Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Humanitarian organizations; Missing persons,"Armed Conflicts; Burial; Cyprus; Exhumation; Forensic Anthropology; History, 20th Century; Humans; Cyprus; exhumation; history; human; physical anthropology; posthumous care; war",,,,,,,"Sant Cassia P., Bodies of evidence: burial, memory and the recovery of missing persons in Cyprus, (2005); Sant Cassia P., Recognition and emotion: exhumations of missing persons in Cyprus, Divided Cyprus: modernity history and an island in conflict, pp. 194-213, (2006); Resolution 3450 (XXX), missing persons in Cyprus, (1975); Resolution 32/128, missing persons in Cyprus, (1977); Resolution 33/172, missing persons in Cyprus, (1978); Resolution 36/163, question of involuntary or enforced disappearances, (1981); Resolution 37/180.

It begins by providing an in-depth historical account of forensic activities, followed by a comparison of the rate of excavations, exhumations and identifications. Through this analysis, a repeated pattern emerges whereby forensic activities in Kosovo start with a surge in values, which drop drastically in the first few years of operations, followed by a steadily declining productivity curve. By contrast, in Cyprus, activities begin modestly, with lower values allowing for some modest growth. Close observation of the two programs provides indications as to the factors that may influence the development of forensic programs as well as the elements that need to be set in place to create an environment conducive to greater sustainability through local ownership and responsibility. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Humanitarian forensic action (HFA); Local capacity building; Missing persons; Post-conflict,Advisory Committees; Armed Conflicts; Autopsy; Body Remains; Cyprus; Exhumation; Forensic Sciences; Humans; International Cooperation; Kosovo; Article; body remains; comparative study; controlled study; Cyprus; exhumation; forensic identification; human; human tissue; Kosovo; priority journal; war; advisory committee; autopsy; exhumation; forensic science; international cooperation; procedures; war,,,,,Rygbi Innovations," The author is especially thankful to Dr. Morris Tidball-Binz of the International Committee of the Red Cross for his advocacy on local capacity building in Cyprus and for his encouragement and ongoing support.

A DVI response was triggered in which expert teams comprising of pathologists, anthropologists, odontologists, radiologists and DNA experts were gathered at the identified operation centre. The Department of Forensic Medicine, Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Alor Star, Kedah, located approximately 75 km away from Wang Kelian, was temporarily converted into a victim identification centre (VIC) as it is the nearest available forensic facility to the mass grave site. The mortuary operation was conducted over a period of 3 months from June to September 2015, and was divided into two phases; phase 1 involving the postmortem examination of the remains of 116 suspected individuals and for phase 2 the remains of 49 suspected individuals. The fact that the graves were of unknown individuals afforded the mass identification operation a sufficient duration of 2 weeks as preparatory phase enabling procedurals and daily victim identification workflow to be established, and the setting up of a temporary body storage for the designated mortuary. The temporary body storage has proven to be a significant factor in enabling the successful conclusion of the VIC operation to the final phase of temporary controlled burials. Recognition from two international observers, Mr. Andréas Patiño Umaña, from the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) and Prof. Noel Woodford from Victoria Institute of Forensic Medicine (VIFM) had proven the mortuary operation was in compliance to the international quality and standards. The overall victim identification and mortuary operation identified a number of significant challenges, in particular the management of commingled human remains as well as the compilation of postmortem data in the absence of antemortem data for future reconciliation. CF Index in this DVI operation is 9%, indicating the primary identifications in this operation were effective. Limitations and further improvements of the mass identification operation will be discussed. This paper details the planning, preparations and management of the mass identification operation on the exhumed human remains which was also a forensic humanitarian service for the dead with dignity and respect. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Clandestine multiple graves; Commingled; Forensic Anthropology Population Data; Forensic humanitarian; Mass identification; Victim identification centre (VIC),Adult; Age Distribution; Autopsy; Body Remains; Burial; Continental Population Groups; Crime Victims; DNA Fingerprinting; Documentation; Female; Forensic Sciences; Human Trafficking; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Mortuary Practice; Sex Distribution; Young Adult; Article; autopsy; body remains; burial; cemetery; controlled study; forensic identification; forensic medicine; genocide; human; human tissue; Malaysia; morgue; postmortem change; priority journal; victim; adult; age distribution; ancestry group; burial; crime victim; DNA fingerprinting; documentation; female; forensic science; human trafficking; male; organization and management; posthumous care; sex ratio; statistics and numerical data; young adult,,,,,Director General of Health Malaysia; Kedah Islamic Religion Council; National Institute of Forensic Medicine; Royal Malaysia Police; State Health Department,"The National Institute of Forensic Medicine (NIFM) greatly acknowledges the tremendous support from the Director General of Health Malaysia, Director of the State Health Department and the Director of the Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah particularly on the provision of the emergency disaster funding as well as the cold storage facility.

In mass disaster situations, anthropologists have traditionally been limited to developing biological profiles from skeletal remains. Over the past decade, however, anthropologists' involvement in DVI has extended well beyond this traditional role as they have taken on increasingly diverse tasks and responsibilities. Anthropological involvement in DVI operations is often dictated by an incident's specific characteristics, particularly events involving extensive fragmentation, commingling, or other forms of compromised remains. This paper will provide examples from recent DVI incidents to illustrate the operational utility of anthropologists in the DVI context. The points where it is most beneficial to integrate anthropologists into the DVI process include: (1) during recovery at the disaster scene; (2) at the triage station as remains are brought into the mortuary; and (3) in conducting the reconciliation process. Particular attention will be paid to quality control and quality assurance measures anthropologists have developed and implemented for DVI projects.

This study uses a subset of the WTC-Human Remains Database to evaluate differential preservation of DNA by skeletal element. Recovery location, sex, and victim type (civilian, firefighter, or plane passenger) do not appear to influence DNA preservation. Results indicate that more intact elements, as well as elements encased in soft tissue, produced slightly higher identification rates than more fragmented remains. DNA identification rates by element type conform to previous findings, with higher rates generally found in denser, weight-bearing bones. However, smaller bones including patellae, metatarsals, and foot phalanges yielded rates comparable to both femora and tibiae. These elements can be easily sampled with a disposable scalpel, and thus reduce potential DNA contamination. These findings have implications for DNA sampling guidelines in future mass fatality incidents. © 2009 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",9/11; DNA identification; forensic anthropology; Forensic science; forensic taphonomy; mass fatality incident; terrorism; victim identification; World Trade Center,"Bone and Bones; Disposable Equipment; DNA; DNA Degradation, Necrotic; DNA Fingerprinting; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Male; Mass Casualty Incidents; September 11 Terrorist Attacks; Specimen Handling; Surgical Instruments; article; DNA determination; DNA fingerprinting; forensic identification; human; mass disaster; metatarsal bone; patella; priority journal; skeleton; soft tissue; tibia; weight bearing",,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,,"Mundorff A.Z., Anthropologist-directed triage: three distinct mass fatality events involving fragmentation of human remains, Recovery, analysis and identification of commingled human remains., pp. 123-44, (2008); Mackinnon G., Mundorff A.Z., The World Trade Center: September 11th, 2001, Forensic human identification: an introduction., pp. 485-99, (2006); Mundorff A.Z., Shaler R.C., Bieschke E., Mar-Cash E.J., Marrying anthropology and DNA: essential for solving complex commingling problems in cases of extreme fragmentation, Recovery, analysis and identification of commingled human remains., pp. 285-300, (2008); Clayton T.M., Whitaker J.P., Maguire C.N., Identification of bodies from the scene of a mass disaster using DNA amplification of short tandem repeat (STR) loci, Forensic Science International, 76, 1, pp. 7-15, (1995); Ludes B., Tracqui A., Pfitzinger H., Kintz P., Levy F., Disteldorf M., Et al., Medico-legal investigations of the Airbus, A320 crash upon Mount Ste-Odile, France, J Forensic Sci, 39, 5, pp. 1147-52, (1994); Leclair B., Fregeau C.J., Bowen K.L., Borys S.B., Elliott J., Fourney R.M., Enhanced kinship analysis and STR-based DNA typing for human identification in mass disasters, Progress in forensic genetics 8.

The bodies of the victims were for the most part buried in mass graves, thrown into riverbeds or disposed of in mines or caves. In this paper, I discuss how forensic examination of the mass graves can yield new evidence about political repression and shed new light on documentary and oral sources. I employ a multidisciplinary approach that combines archaeology and forensic anthropology to reconstruct the facts around the killings and produce new historical knowledge about the traumatic past of contemporary Spanish society. © 2021 EQUINOX PUBLISHING LTD",conflict archaeology; forensic anthropology; history; mass graves; material culture,,,,,,"Government of Extremadura; European Social Fund, ESF, (FSE-2014-2020, PO17015)","This work was supported by the Postdoctoral fellowship of the General Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation from the Government of Extremadura funded by the European Social Fund Operational Program FSE-2014-2020 [PO17015].","Arostegui Sanchez J., La investigación histórica.

Within Franco?s repressive system there was a specific procedure applied to Republican women. In this article, I provide an analysis of the repression suffered by women during the Spanish Civil War and Franco?s dictatorship in southwest Spain. For that purpose, I draw on stories of female victims, who suffered physical and psychological humiliation, and on mass graves with bodies of women. The research is based on a holistic study of material, oral and written sources from a historical, archaeological and forensic anthropological perspective. It is argued that the different repressive strategies used against the female population by Spanish fascism was motivated by the perception of women as second-class citizens and therefore inferior to men. Their punishment followed criteria of exemplarity. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",archaeology of the contemporary past; forensic anthropology; gendered repression; Mass graves; oral history,Spain; civil war; gender role; holistic approach; political history; political relations; political violence; social history; womens status,,,,,"European Social Fund, (PO17015); Government of Extremadura; European Social Fund, ESF, (FSE-2014-2020)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Postdoctoral fellowship of the General Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation from the Government of Extremadura funded by the European Social Fund Operational Program FSE-2014-2020 [PO17015].

The re-emergence of forensic archaeology and anthropology within Australia relies on its diversification and cooperation with established forensic medical organizations, law enforcement forensic service divisions, and national forensic boards. This presents a unique opportunity to develop a new multidisciplinary approach to forensic archaeology/anthropology within Australia as we hold a unique set of environmental, social, and cultural conditions that diverge from overseas models and require different methodological approaches. In the current world political climate, more forensic techniques are being applied at scenes of mass disasters, genocide, and terrorism.

Children at high risk of becoming victims of trafficking are runaways, children with a history of abuse, and migrant children. Internationally, cases of child trafficking are increasing the most in Europe, which is likely the result of the current migration crisis. In crises, preventing and combating human trafficking needs to be prioritized, considering that the aims of humanitarian action include saving lives, easing suffering and preserving human dignity. The involvement of forensic practitioners in investigations of cases of child trafficking mainly concerning the identification of victims may save lives and certainly alleviate suffering of the child victims and their families searching for them. Moreover, by aiding the prosecution process through thorough documentation and expert reporting forensic practitioners may contribute to the protection, rehabilitation and possibly compensation of the child victims, and thus to the restoration of their rights and dignity. So far, forensic practitioners were rarely specifically mentioned as actors in the counter-trafficking efforts in the multitude of policies, regulations, guidelines and recommendations concerning different aspects of child trafficking. This seems surprising considering that the expertise and experience of practitioners from forensic sciences including cyber forensics, document analysis, forensic biology, anthropology, and medicine can be utilised for gathering intelligence in cases of suspected human trafficking, for identifying the victims as well as perpetrators, and for securing evidence for legal proceedings as this paper shows. While this article mainly discusses the role of forensic pathologists and anthropologists, with a specific focus on the identification of child victims of trafficking in the context of the European migration crisis, the notions regarding the contribution of forensic sciences to the counter-trafficking efforts can be adapted to other geographical and sociopolitical contexts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Children; Forensic assessment; Human trafficking; Identification; Migration; Missing,Child; Child Welfare; Cooperative Behavior; Crime Victims; Europe; Forensic Sciences; Guidelines as Topic; Human Trafficking; Humans; Professional Role; Transients and Migrants; anthropology; Article; child abuse; child protection; child trafficking; cyber forensic; documentation; European; forensic medicine; forensic pathology; forensic science; geography; health promotion; human; human dignity; human rights; human trafficking; institutional care; intelligence; life saving; migration; migration crisis; policy; politics; practice guideline; priority journal; protection; rehabilitation care; socioeconomics; child; child welfare; cooperation; crime victim; Europe; forensic science; human trafficking; legislation and jurisprudence; prevention and control; professional standard; statistics and numerical data,,,,,,,"United Nations, Protocol to Prevent, Supress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, (2000); Council of Europe, Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, Council of Europe Treaty Series No. 197, (2005); European Union, Directive 2011 /36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA, (2011); Red Cross, Perilous Journeys.

Over 60% of these victims is buried unidentified: one of the reasons behind this is related to the specific difficulties and lack of strategies concerning AM and PM data collection. The present article describes how Italy is trying to face the problem of migrant identification, thanks to the collaboration between government, the Italian national police and universities. In particular, this is the first pilot study carried out to identify the victims of the second greatest tragedy of its kind off the Italian coast, near Lampedusa, on October 3rd 2013, which caused 366 victims. The present article shows the strategies conceived to collect postmortem and especially antemortem data and to compare them to identify matches, using medicolegal, anthropological, odontological and genetic approaches. Thirty-one victims out of 53 missing sought by relatives were identified (58.5%). The type and the quality of antemortem data available, generally photos and videos, pinpoints the importance of the face and the body for identification when the bodies are well preserved and how DNA analyses may at times present difficulties. In fact, critical points emerged concerning especially the lack of genetic information of the populations to which the victims belonged, the number of genetic markers needed to reach a statistical support for the identification and the need to adopt lineage markers such as mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome polymorphisms to identify parental relationships. This pilot study however has proven that families continue to seek their relatives and that it is possible, as well as mandatory, to identify migrant victims in spite of the difficulties in the collection of antemortem and postmortem data. In addition, considering the peculiar scenario, novel strategies for positive identification have to be defined in each field (anthropological, odontological and genetic) as well as in combination. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Anthropology; Dead migrants; DNA; Humanitarian forensic sciences; Identification; Mediterranean sea,Accidents; Biometric Identification; Body Remains; DNA; DNA Fingerprinting; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Mediterranean Sea; Microsatellite Repeats; Photography; Pilot Projects; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ships; Tattooing; Transients and Migrants; mitochondrial DNA; DNA; microsatellite DNA; anthropology; Article; cadaver identification; comparative study; disaster victim; genetic analysis; genetic marker; human; medicolegal aspect; Mediterranean Sea; migrant; odontology; pilot study; posthumous care; priority journal; Y chromosome; accident; biometry; body remains; DNA fingerprinting; forensic science; isolation and purification; migration; photography; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; ship; tattooing,,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, ",,,,,"Brian T., Laczko F., Fatal Journeys: Tracking Lives Lost During Migration, (2014); Brian T., Laczko F., Fatal Journeys, Volume 2: Identification and Tracing of Dead and Missing Migrants, (2016); Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, (1977); The Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, (2002); Cattaneo C., Tidball Binz M., Penados L., Prieto J., Finegan O., Grandi M., The forgotten tragedy of unidentified dead in the Mediterranean, Forensic Sci.

This research examines trends in the role of forensic anthropology and forensic archaeology at fatal fire scenes. A total of 218 forensic archaeological searches and/or recoveries were conducted over the 38-year period. Of these, 36 were categorized as fire cases for which the Mercyhurst Forensic Scene Recovery Team (M-FSRT) processed the scene, even in the event that a body was not found. Data were collected from these cases on location, fire type, season of fire recovery, and manner of fire (accidental or intentional). Fire searches/recoveries spanned four U.S. states and all seasons, with the greatest number of cases occurring in the fall (36%) and an equal number of cases involving fires outdoors and within structures. The majority of fire scene recoveries were related to events that were accidental, such as the wrecks of automobiles, airplanes, and trains, as opposed to intentional. From 1983 to 2009, 15% of all searches/recoveries involved fire, while in the past 10 years (2010?2020), that percentage has increased to 17.4%. Over half of the total fire recovery cases were conducted between 2015 and 2020. Considering the increasing involvement of forensic anthropologists in fatal fire recoveries and the diversity of fatal fire scenes, it is imperative that best practices be accessible to assist forensic anthropologists in approaching scenes of this nature. This research provides recommendations toward scene processing and the incorporation of forensic archaeological methods at the fire scene. © 2022 University of Florida Press.",fatal fires; forensic archaeology; forensic case studies; forensic taphonomy,,,,,,,,"Cabo LL, Dirkmaat DC., Forensic archaeology in the United States, Forensic Archaeology: A Global Perspective, pp. 255-270, (2015); Celentano J., Butte County?s response to the 2018 California camp fire, Proceedings of the 72nd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, (2020); Climate-Data.org; De Boer HH, Blau S, Delabarde T, Hackman L., The role of forensic anthropology in disaster victim identification (DVI): Recent developments and future prospects, Forensic Sciences Research, 4, 4, pp. 303-315, (2019); DeHaan J., Fire and bodies, The Analysis of Burned Human Remains, pp. 1-13, (2015); Dirkmaat DC., Recovery and interpretation of the fatal fire victim: The role of forensic anthropology, Advances in Forensic Taphonomy: Method, Theory, and Archaeological Perspectives, pp. 451-472, (2002); Dirkmaat DC, Adovasio JM., The role of archaeology in the recovery and interpretation of human remains, Forensic Taphonomy: The Postmortem Fate of Human Remains, pp. 39-64, (1997); Dirkmaat DC, Cabo LL., Forensic archaeology and forensic taphonomy: Basic considerations on how to properly process and interpret the outdoor forensic scene, Academic Forensic Pathology, 6, 3, pp. 439-454, (2016); Dirkmaat DC, Olson GO, Klales AR, Getz S., The role of forensic anthropology in the recovery and interpretation of the fatal-fire victim, A Companion to Forensic Anthropology, pp. 113-135, (2012); Dirkmaat DC, Symes SA., New protocols for the recovery and interpretation of burned human remains, NIJ Forensic Anthropology R&D Focus Group Meeting, (2009); Haglund WD, Sorg MH, Forensic Taphonomy: The Postmortem Fate of Human Remains, (1997); Haglund WD, Sorg MH, Advances in Forensic Taphonomy: Method, Theory, and Archaeological Perspectives, (2002); Harbeck M, Schleuder R, Schneider J, Wiechmann I, Schmahl W., Research potential and limitations of trace analyses of cremated remains, Forensic Science International, 204, 1?3, pp. 191-200, (2011); Harris J, Smith RE, Hawkins CW., The complicated recovery of a house fire victim in northern Michigan, Proceedings of the 72nd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, (2020); Mayne Correia PM., Fire modification of bone: A review of the literature, Forensic Taphonomy: The Postmortem Fate of Human Remains, pp. 275-293, (1997); Mayne Correia PM, Beattie O., A critical look at methods for recovering, evaluating, and interpreting cremated human remains, Advances in Forensic Taphonomy: Method, Theory, and Archaeological Perspectives, pp. 435-450, (2002); Milligan CF., An overview of the camp fire and wildfire situation in the west, Proceedings of the 72nd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, (2020); Mincer HH, Berryman HE, Murray GA, Dickens RL., Methods for physical stabilization of ashed teeth in incinerated remains, Journal of Forensic Sciences, 35, pp. 971-974, (1990); NFPA 921: Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations, (2008); Fire and Arson Scene Evidence: A Guide for Public Safety Personnel, (2000); Owsley DW., Identification of the fragmentary, burned remains of two U.S. journalists seven years after their disappearance in Guatemala, Journal of Forensic Sciences, 38, 6, pp. 1372-1382, (1993); Pilloud MA, Bartelink EJ, Kendell A, Milligan C., Forensic anthropology in a changing climate, Anthropology News, 61, 2, pp. 3-6, (2020); Randolph-Quinney P., Burnt human remains part 1: Fire dynamics and body recovery, Advances in Forensic Human Identification, pp. 127-144, (2014); Schmidt CW, Symes SA, The Analysis of Burned Human Remains, (2015); Symes SA, Dirkmaat DC, Ousley S, Chapman E, Cabo L., Recovery and Interpretation of Burned Human Remains, (2012); Thompson TJ., Heat-induced dimensional changes in bone and their consequences for forensic anthropology, Journal of Forensic Sciences, 50, 5, pp. 1008-1015, (2005); Topoleski JJ, Christensen AM., Use of a gelatin-based consolidant to preserve thermally-altered skeletal remains, Journal of Forensic Sciences, 64, 4, pp. 1135-1138, (2019); Ubelaker DH., The forensic evaluation of burned skeletal remains: A synthesis, Forensic Science International, 183, pp. 1-5, (2009); Ubelaker DH, Owsley DW, Houck MM, Et al., The role of forensic anthropology in the recovery and analysis of Branch Davidian Compound victims: Recovery procedures and characteristics of the victims, Journal of Forensic Sciences, 40, 3, pp. 335-340, (1995); Pennsylvania fire loss/fire department profile; U.S. fire statistics","A.

This presentation deals with one aspect of the forensic anthropological contribution to this collaborative endeavor-the examination and inventory of human skeletal remains and the interpretation of these osteological data. Briefly described first are the content and format of the skeletal inventory and the examination procedures used for data collection. Two subsequent sections illustrate the use of these data to determine (a) age, sex, ancestry, stature, and other distinguishing characteristics, and (b) the presence and nature of any premortem, perimortem, and postmortem trauma. The next section shows how these findings assist in establishing positive identification through, for example, comparison with medical, dental, and other background records, especially comparison of premortem and postmortem radiographs of bones or dentition. In this context, we consider also the sorting of commingled remains, which includes preliminary assessment of rapidly decomposing remains prior to autopsy to preserve information crucial to identification.",Branch Davidians; commingled remains; human identification; mass disaster; physical anthropology; trauma,anthropology; female; forensic identification; human; injury; inventory control; male; physical anthropology; priority journal; review; skeleton,,,,,,,,,,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,,,,,,221198,,JFSCA,7782738,English,J.

Specifically, descriptions and criteria used to characterize aircraft deceleration- versus blast-related skeletal injuries are examined from 35 recently identified forensic anthropology cases to determine possible diagnostic traits and characterize skeletal trauma associated with these events. Among these cases, blast trauma is more localized within the skeleton and is associated with one or few primary directions of force. It is recommended that analysts differentiate between secondary and nonspecific blast trauma categories. Conversely, aircraft crash deceleration trauma is more widespread throughout the skeleton, with torsional fractures and injuries occurring from multiple or indeterminate directions. These traits reflect factors such as more complex loading environments than is seen in blast events. Two case studies are presented in detail to further illustrate differences in aircraft crash and blast-related incidents. Both studies emphasize consideration of the body as a whole unit to facilitate interpretations. While the cases presented herein result from historic war-related casualties that characterize the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency?s (DPAA) casework, these skeletal cases provide guidelines more appropriate than clinically derived criteria developed through assessments of soft tissue injuries. These guidelines can be used by anthropologists and pathologists working with skeletal remain from mass disasters and other complex contexts, as well as provide avenues for future research. © 2020 American Academy of Forensic Sciences",aircraft crash; blast injuries; blunt force trauma; forensic anthropology; historic aircraft; projectile trauma; skeletal trauma; World War II,"Accidents, Aviation; Biomechanical Phenomena; Blast Injuries; Body Remains; Forensic Anthropology; Fractures, Bone; Humans; World War II; aircraft accident; biomechanics; blast injury; body remains; forensic anthropology; fracture; human; pathology; war",,,,,,,"Berryman H.E., Lanfear A.K., Shirley N.R., The biomechanics of gunshot trauma to bone: research considerations within the present judicial climate, A companion to forensic anthropology, pp. 390-399, (2012); Symes S.A., L'Abbe E.N., Chapman E.N., Wolff I., Dirkmaat D.C., Interpreting traumatic injury from bone in medicolegal investigations, A companion to forensic anthropology, pp. 340-389, (2012); Emanovsky P., Low-velocity impact trauma: an illustrative selection of cases from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command ?

The CMP operates strictly within a humanitarian framework, using a multidisciplinary approach to conclude individual identifications of remains exhumed throughout the island, where all information obtained from different phases of the CMP Project is integrated and assessed in a comprehensive manner. By 2017, although over 1000 sets of remains were recovered and either identified or resolved by the CMP, 137 challenging cases remained unidentified at the CMP Anthropological Laboratory. To resolve these cases, different strategies were adopted where the investigatory component was enhanced through the implementation of new data mining approaches, and the genetic-related data were revised and updated through the adoption of new DNA technologies and the improvement of the Family Reference Samples Database. These new approaches resulted in a dramatic reduction of the number of unidentified cases (by over 70 %) as well as the timeframe required for future identifications. These approaches could serve as an example in other humanitarian contexts facing similar challenges as they can have a profound impact on the families of missing persons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",CMP humanitarian project; Enhanced investigatory approaches; Forensic science; Missing persons; Multi-disciplinary identification approach; Unidentified human skeletal remains,"Body Remains; Cyprus; Databases, Genetic; DNA Fingerprinting; Exhumation; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Pedigree; adoption; adult; article; body remains; Cyprus; data mining; female; forensic science; human; human experiment; male; Cyprus; DNA fingerprinting; exhumation; forensic anthropology; genetic database; organization and management; pedigree",,,,,,,"General Assembly of the United Nations, Resolution 3450 (XXX), Missing Persons in Cyprus, (1975); General Assembly of the United Nations, Resolution 32/128, Missing Persons in Cyprus, (1977); General Assembly of the United Nations, Resolution 33/172, Missing Persons in Cyprus, (1978); General Assembly of the United Nations, Resolution 36/164, Missing Persons in Cyprus, (1981); Zorba G.K., Eleftheriou T., Engin I., Hartsioti S., Zenonos C., Forensic identification of human remains in Cyprus: the humanitarian work of The Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (CMP), Forensic Science and Humanitarian Action: Interacting with the Dead and the Living, pp. 609-623, (2020); Ktori M., Moyssi N., Kahraman D., Korkmaz E., Methodology issues of forensic excavations at coastal sites, J.

Because bodies were piled one over another within the train, appropriate methodology during the recovery was critical to identifying the victims. The disaster area was thoroughly documented with notes, photographs, and schematic drawings of the various locations. The recovery team, comprising two medical examiners and one forensic anthropologist, decided when charred body parts and cremated bones were linked to the same individual based on the anatomy and forensic anthropological examination. Without these recovery procedures, it would not have been possible to efficiently harvest representative DNA sample from most of the victims' body parts. After the entire process of identification, 136 victims were positively identified, and six victims remained unidentified. This study supports the crucial role of forensic anthropologists in the recovery of victims, especially in fire scenes. © 2009 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Disaster; Fire scenes; Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Identification; Recovery,DNA; article; controlled study; fatality; fire; human; Korea; mass disaster; physical anthropology; priority journal; railway; victim,,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,,"McCormick M.M., The National Transportation Safety Board and the investigation of civil aviation and transportation accidents, Am J Forensic Med Pathol, 1, pp. 239-243, (1980); Han K.H., Choi D.H., Jo G.R., Park D.K., Han S.H., Kim K.H., Et al., Mass disaster operational system of an aircraft accident in Korea, Korean J Legal Med, 26, pp. 36-41, (2002); Han K.H., Jo G.R., Park D.K., Lee U.Y., Han S.H., Kim J., Et al., Anatomy in disaster victim identification - Air China crash near Kimhae airport, Korean J Anat, 36, pp. 39-47, (2003); Ubelaker D.H., Owsley D.W., Houck M.M., Craig E., Grant W., Woltanski T., Et al., The role of forensic anthropology in the recovery and analysis of Branch Davidian Compound victims: Recovery procedures and characteristics of the victims, J Forensic Sci, 40, pp. 335-340, (1995); Owsley D.W., Ubelaker D.H., Houck M.M., Sandness K.L., Grant W.E., Craig E.A., Et al., The role of forensic anthropology in the recovery and analysis of Branch Davidian Compound victims: Techniques of analysis, J Forensic Sci, 40, pp. 341-348, (1995); Grevin G., Bailet P., Quatrehomme G., Ollier A., Anatomical reconstruction of fragments of burned human bones: A necessary means for forensic identification, Forensic Sci Int, 96, pp. 129-134, (1998); Rainio J., Hedman M., Karkola K., Lalu K., Peltola P., Ranta H., Et al., Forensic osteological investigations in Kosovo, Forensic Sci Int, 121, pp. 166-173, (2001); Brothwell D.R., Digging Up Bones, 3rd Edn., (1981); Ubelaker D.H., Human Skeletal Remains, 3rd Edn., (1999); White T.D., Folkens P.A., Human Osteology, 2nd Edn., (2000); Mayne Correia P.M., Fire modification of bone: A review of the literature, Forensic Taphonomy: The Postmortem Fate of Human Remains., pp. 275-293, (1997); Schuliar Y., Benthaus S., Disaster handling procedures, Disaster Victim Identification: A Challenge to the New Millennium.

Violent death has been one of the manifestations of these processes, where the violated body contains a strong load of meanings when they are not culturally catered to. A type of applied anthropology linked to the forensic context, human rights, and humanitarian action has been contributing to the direct documentation of millions of bloody episodes. Peru has not been the exception; after a period of armed violence (1980-2000), there are tens of thousands of people dead, and people reported missing. Today, the aftermath is widely notorious. On the one hand, relatives continue to search for missing loved ones. On the other hand, there are landscapes and rural communities where there are still sites of clandestine deposits of dead bodies and body parts. A cultural, social, and humanitarian breakdown has been faced, where the bad death persists in the social imaginary of the communities, contaminating the cultural landscape of the populations. Forensic anthropology has been able to identify, register, and systematize these deathscapes, which still persist in liminality. New challenges must be conducted to tackle this issue.  © 2022 by the Society for Applied Anthropology.",,Peru; anthropology; human rights; humanitarian aid; mortality; rural area; violence,,,,,Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences; Ministry of Justice and Human Rights of Peru,"The authors of this document wish to recognize and highlight the important work of the General Directorate of Search for Disappeared Persons of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights of Peru.

Adverse conditions, however, have resulted in many human casualties over the years. On the Greek side, 334 cadavers were retrieved between 2000 and 2014. This study provides a detailed forensic account of the humanitarian disaster in Evros to create an official scientific record of the situation. It showcases the gravity of the global issue of migration relating to health and mortality, and encourages communication and continual improvement of the approach and patterns of practices surrounding the subject. A retrospective statistical research review was conducted of border-related fatalities between 2000 and 2014, assessing the age and gender of victims, the cause of death, the location of bodies, identification rates, and country of origin. Age ranged generally from 24 to 29 years, but infants and children were among the deceased. © 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, numerous fatalities occurred in peacetime as migrants attempted to avoid Greek border checks. Numerous fatal incidents (51) were detected inside the Greek minefields between 1997 and 2008. Determination of age, sex, time of death, and nationality were evaluated in every case. The injuries' anatomical dispersion, their severity, and the mechanism of death were examined in relation to the victims' position at the moment of the explosion. Data research indicated that all victims were male, aged 18-30 in their majority, crossing border minefields mainly during the night. Their distance and position in relation to the point of detonation was a key factor in the trauma localization and severity. This review highlights the devastating consequences of the residual mines during peacetime, a situation that continues to be a persistent international problem. © 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Forensic anthropology; Forensic pathology; Forensic science; Greece; Human remains; Illegal immigrants; Land borders; Minefield; Mines,Blast Injuries; Cause of Death; Demography; Explosions; Greece; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; Transients and Migrants; Turkey; blast injury; cause of death; demography; explosion; Greece; human; male; migration; retrospective study,,,,,,,"The UN Refugee Agency: Sixteen people drowned attempting to cross the Evros River border between Turkey and Greece; Trilling D., In Greece, a river holds tragedy for migrants; Papadakis S.A., Babourda E.C., Mitsitskas T.C., Markakidis S., Bachtis C., Koukouvis D., Et al., Anti-personnel landmine injuries during peace: experience in a European country, Prehosp Disaster Med, 21, pp. 237-240, (2006); Haertig A., Crainic K., Durigon M., Medicolegal identification by the dental system, Presse Med, 14, 9, pp. 543-545, (1985); Kashyap V.K., Koteswara Rao N.R., A modified Gustafson method of age estimation from teeth, Forensic Sci Int, 47, 3, pp. 237-247, (1990); Olze A., Hertel J., Schulz R., Wierer T., Schmeling A., Radiographic evaluation of Gustafson's criteria for the purpose of forensic age diagnostics, Int J Legal Med, 126, 4, pp. 615-621, (2012); Brickley M., McKinley J.I., Guidelines to the standards for recording human remains, (2004); Kirk J.D., Cranial suture closure: a quantitative method for age estimation using laser instrumentation [thesis], (2007); Buikstra J.E., Ubelaker D.H., Standards for data collection from human skeletal remains, Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, (1994); Andersson N., Palha da Sousa C., Paredes S., Social cost of land mines in four countries: Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia, and Mozambique, BMJ, 311, pp. 718-721, (1995); Giannou C., Antipersonnel landmines: facts, fictions, and priorities, BMJ, 315, (1997); Cobey J., Ayotte B., Tools to measure landmine incidents and injuries, Lancet, 355, (2000); Saukko P., Knight B., Knight's forensic pathology, pp. 274-276, (2004); Bilukha O.O., Brennan M., Woodruff B.A., Death and injury from landmines and unexploded ordnance in Afghanistan, JAMA, 290, pp. 650-653, (2003); Khan M.T., Husain F.N., Ahmed A., Hindfoot injuries due to landmine blast accidents, Int J Care Injured, 33, pp. 167-171, (2002); Jaha L., Andreevska T., Rudari H., Ademi B., Ismaili-Jaha V., A decade of civilian vascular trauma in Kosovo, World J Emerg Surg, 7, 1, (2012); Keyes D.C., Burstein J.L., Schwartz R.B., Swienton R.E., Medical response to terrorism: preparedness and clinical practice, pp. 201-202, (2005); Sasser S.M., Sattin R.W., Hunt R.C., Krohmer J., Blast lung injury, Prehosp Emerg Care, 10, 2, pp. 165-172, (2006); pp. 37-38, (2004); Heshmati A., Khayyat N.T., Analysis of landmine fatalities and injuries in the Kurdistan region, J Interpers Violence, 30, 15, pp. 2591-2615, (2015); Mannion S., Chaloner E., Landmines and landmine injuries: an overview, Pain Med, 7, 2, pp. 1995-2005, (2006); Coupland R., Korver A., Injuries from anti-personnel mines: the experience of the International Committee of the Red Cross, BMJ, 331, pp. 1509-1512, (1991); Bilgic S., Kilincoglu V., Kurklu M., Yurttas Y., Ozkan H., Sehirlioglu A., Burst fracture of the lumbar vertebra due to a landmine injury: a case report, Cases J, 2, (2009); Jahunlu H.R., Husum H., Wisborg T., Mortality in land-mine accidents in Iran, Prehosp Disaster Med, 17, 2, pp. 107-109, (2002); Hougen H.P., Petersen H.D., Lykke J., Mannstaedt M., Ussing B., Death and injury caused by land mines in Burma, Sci Justice, 40, 1, pp. 21-25, (2000); Landmine-related injuries, 1993-1996, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep., 46, 31, pp. 724-726, (1997); Pearn J., Landmines: time for an international ban, BMJ, 312, pp. 990-991, (1996)","P.

The 335 civilians were taken to the ""Cave Ardeatine"" and they were shot. Only 323 corpses out of 335 have been identified. The aim of this work is the genetic and anthropological analysis of the remains exhumed from grave number 329 of Fosse Ardeatine's Shrine to assess their identity. So far, such remains have been supposed to belong to MM but mitochondrial analysis excluded a biological relationship to two living maternal relatives. Our analysis indicated that remains recovered in grave number 329 do not belong to MM. This result suggests that genetic analysis of the remains should be also applied to the other 12 unknown corpses to elucidate their identity. © 2009 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",anthropological;

Four months later forensic examination led to the identification of 323 out of 335 victims. After approximately 60 years, the identification of the remaining unidentified twelve victims began with anthropological and genetic analysis carried out by a team of Italian forensic experts. Anthropological analysis was performed in field in order to confirm the sex of each victim and verify the presence of only one individual in each grave for a correct sampling. Selected bone fragments for each individual were then collected and transferred to the laboratory for genetic analysis. Although the anthropological ante mortem information was limited, morphological and metrical data was collected for a possible future identification of the victims. Subsequently, the typing of autosomal loci, Y-STR and mtDNA D-loop region of all bone and available reference samples was conducted. LR and cumulative LRs obtained from autosomal STR and Y-STR results confirmed the alleged relationship between three victims and their relatives with values over 104 (one sample) and 106 (two samples). Therefore, the genetic analysis offered the families the possibility of replacing the number of the grave with the name of the victim. © 2018 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences",Anthropological analysis; Forensic science; Genetic identification; Mass disaster; STRs and mtDNA,Bone and Bones; Crime Victims; DNA Fingerprinting; Exhumation; Forensic Anthropology; Homicide; Humans; Italy; World War II; cell nucleus DNA; mitochondrial DNA; amplicon; Article; body height; body remains; comparative study; controlled study; DNA determination; DNA sequence; forensic medicine; genetic analysis; haplogroup; human; human tissue; short tandem repeat; skeleton; temporal bone; victim; bone; chemistry; crime victim; DNA fingerprinting; exhumation; forensic anthropology; homicide; Italy; procedures; war,,,,,ANFIM; National Association of Italian Families Martyrs; Religious Authorities of the Catholic and Jewish Communities,"We are very grateful to Jonathan Kyte and Claudia Agostino for providing language support and invaluable advices in proof reading the article., All operations were performed in the presence of the ANFIM's (National Association of Italian Families Martyrs) representatives (Mrs. Nicoletta Leoni -ANFIM Associate Director- and Mr. Aladino Lombardi -ANFIM Secretary-General-) and the Religious Authorities of the Catholic and Jewish Communities.

Mangiagalli 37, Milan, 20133, Italy","The skeletal sex and ancestry of unidentified human crania can be inferred both from physical and from molecular features. This paper depicts and discusses the experiences of physical and molecular anthropologists on a set of commingled crania from the largest Mediterranean shipwreck disaster on 18 April 2015, in order to facilitate identification of human crania. Twenty-one disarticulated crania that were recovered from the above-mentioned shipwreck were analyzed to estimate skeletal sex and ancestry, following a physical and a molecular pipeline. The physical analyses applied morphological and metric methods that provided posterior probabilities for the crania to be classified into a sex or ancestral group. The molecular analyses were performed on petrous bones via a shotgun sequencing approach that allowed us to determine the sex of each individual and to retrieve the complete mitochondrial genome, Y chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms, up to 597573 SNPs across the human genome from each individual. The morphometric sex analyses showed that most crania belonged to male individuals, although some estimations remained uncertain or undetermined. Inconsistent results were obtained for ancestry estimation as well, since morphological methods classified the crania mostly as European/White, in contrast to the most numerous African forms determined by craniometric analyses. This quite agreed with molecular analyses that identified only African males. Overall, undetermined and contrasting results were obtained between disciplines, preventing the creation of reliable and sound biological profiles that could provide guidance on the sex and ancestral group of the victims. Therefore, the times may not be mature for a merger of physical and molecular anthropology. However, future investigations of this research avenue would pave the way to the possible development of novel tools, methods, and wider reference databases that could address the limitations of both disciplines. © 2023 by the authors.",ancestry; DNA; forensic anthropology; migrants; skeletal sex,adult; African; anthropology; article; disaster; forensic anthropology; human; human genome; male; migrant; mitochondrial genome; petrous bone; pipeline; probability; reference database; ship; shotgun sequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism; sound; victim; Y chromosome,,,,,"Università degli Studi di Milano, UniMi, (31855); Università degli Studi di Milano, UniMi","This research was funded by the University of Milan, Piano di Sostegno alla Ricerca dell?Università degli Studi di Milano 2019 (PSR2019-DEANGELIS-Linea 2-Studio dei caratteri dentari e genetici di un campione di scheletri subsahariani a fini identificativi N. 31855).","Cattaneo C., Tidball Binz M., Penados L., Prieto J., Finegan O., Grandi M., The Forgotten Tragedy of Unidentified Dead in the Mediterranean, Forensic Sci.

The attacks evidenced a series of significant deficiencies in forensic task planning, especially in using standardised post-mortem data forms and gathering ante-mortem medical and dental data, responsible for the delay in identifying corpses in the worst state, which had to wait for DNA analysis. Fortunately, the ultimate result can be considered satisfactory, given the rapid response of the forensic team in examination and identification of the large number of victims (80% of the victims were identified within 40 h), consequence of a good mortuary organization in the Pavilion 6 of the Madrid Trade Fair (IFEMA), the professional fervor whereupon the different involved professionals acted, some personal initiatives and the good general state of most of the corpses. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Forensic medicine; Human identification; Madrid M11; Mass disaster; Terrorist attack,Cooperative Behavior; Disaster Planning; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Dentistry; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Mortuary Practice; Spain; Terrorism; article; autopsy; cadaver; DNA determination; forensic identification; human; posthumous care; priority journal; Spain; terrorism; victim,,,,,,,"Moody G.H., Busuttil A., Identification in the Lockerbie air disaster, Am J Forensic Med Pathol, 15, pp. 63-69, (1994); Busuttil A., Jones J.S.P., Green M.A., Deaths in Major Disasters-the Pathologist's Role, (2000); De Winne, La Catástrofe del ferry de Zeebrugge. la experiencia de la Gendarmeria Belga, INTERPOL Revista Internacional de Policía Criminal, 437-438, pp. 6-17, (1992); Beale D.R., The importance of dental records for identification, NZ Dent J, 87, pp. 84-87, (1991); Angyal M., Derczy K., Personal identification on the basis of antemortem and post-mortem radiographs, J Forensic Sci, 43, pp. 1089-1093, (1998); Van Der Kuiji B., Van Der Pols L.C., Forensic odontological identification of disaster victims.

A man voluntarily drove a truck into a crowd gathered for the fireworks display on the seaside ?Promenade des Anglais,? plowing pedestrians down over more than 2 km before being shot dead. At the time of this report, a total of 86 casualties and more than 1200 formal complaints for physical and psychological injuries have been recorded. The aim of this work is to describe the forensic management of this event and its immediate aftermath. This paper reaffirms the basic tenets of disaster management: a single place of work, teamwork in times of crisis, a single communication channel with families and the media, and the validation of the identifications by a multidisciplinary commission. This paper highlights other essential aspects of the organization of the forensic effort put in place after the Nice attack: the contribution of the police at the crime scene, the cooperation between the disaster victim identification (DVI) team, and the forensic pathologists at the morgue, applying the identification (ID) process to unconscious victims in the intensive care unit, the input of volunteers, and the logistics associated with the management of the aftermath of the event. All of the victims were positively identified within 4 and a half days. For the first time in such a paper, the central role of medical students in the immediate aftermath of the disaster is outlined. The need to address the possible psychological trauma of the non-medical and even the medical staff taking part in the forensic effort is also reaffirmed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",forensic identification; mass disaster; Mass murder; Nice terrorist attack,"Autopsy; Body Remains; Cooperative Behavior; Disaster Victims; Disasters; Forensic Sciences; France; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Morgue; Police; Terrorism; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; autopsy; body remains; cooperation; disaster; disaster victim; forensic science; France; human; morgue; organization and management; police; public relations; terrorism; x-ray computed tomography",,,,,Forensic Department,"We very much wish to thank all of the professionals and all of the volunteers that worked together during this terrible event: members of the police and gendarmerie, forensic pathologists, forensic anthropologists, forensic odontologists, radiologists, radiology technicians, medical students, secretaries, and morgue technicians.

Disaster victim identification is a procedure that has achieved international standardisation through the work of a multinational Interpol Standing Committee. While part of a police organisation, it includes forensic pathologists, anthropologists, odontologists and molecular biologists who provide most of the specialist scientific input regarding identification that is integrated with police processes such as document examination and fingerprinting. The loss of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 represented a major activation of these procedures in an environment that had both humanitarian and forensic criminal investigation components. The information that is derived from the processes involved in disaster victim identification has a value that goes far beyond the determination of identity.

We present here four cases where signs of autopsy were observed in the remains recovered from mass graves and cemeteries of prisoners from the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), victims of extrajudicial executions, and of death in prison, respectively. With respect to the former, historical evidence indicate that during the first weeks after the coup, official removal of cadavers and autopsy procedures were carried out to the first victims of extrajudicial killings, whose corpses were found abandoned in the road. Once the civil war was established and systematic extrajudicial killings were systematic, official military orders were issued to stop standard forensic proceedings. Therefore, autopsy marks observed in the remains exhumed from mass graves located in cemeteries may be indicative of an earlier chronology of the killings, and this information proved to be relevant for the identification process in one of the cases presented. In a cemetery of political prisoners, autopsy signs were also observed in two skeletal remains and in the official records of two prisoners, a corroboration of information also relevant for the identification process. These findings indicate that autopsy marks can be found in the remains of victims of human rights violations exhumed from cemeteries. Skeletal and archival information could be useful for the identification process in other cases of large-scale violence, where the first victims of extrajudicial executions were buried unidentified in cemeteries after autopsy procedures. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Autopsy marks; Cemetery; Extrajudicial execution; Identification; Spanish Civil War,"Autopsy; Bone and Bones; Crime Victims; Exhumation; History, 20th Century; Humans; Male; Prisoners; Spain; Warfare; autopsy; bone; crime victim; exhumation; history; human; male; pathology; prisoner; Spain; warfare",,,,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (CSO2012-32709)",The authors would like to thank the families for the trust deposited in our team and the patience along the identification process.

To ensure their success, they displayed the most extreme forms of repression, including imprisonment, forced exile, murder and the disappearance of thousands of political opponents. This paper examines the regional particularities of the clandestine repression in Argentina, specifically in the military jurisdiction known as Area 211, which was subordinated to the II Defense Zone Command.

The historical experiences of each country displayed notable differences, especially regarding their economic projects?ranging from a national-oriented industrialism in Brazil, up to an experimental laboratory for neoliberalism in Pinochet?s Chile?as well as the specific features of their political regime and its relationship with the traditional parties. However, despite the differences between the models applied in each country, the cycle of the Southern Cone dictatorships was indeed a regional phenomenon, in which successive military coups took place in the context of a progressive radicalization of social and political mobilization. With the political approval and financial support from the U.S. government and the local economic elites, the military governments instituted terror regimes in order to achieve a de-politicization of civil society through fear. To ensure the success of their project, they displayed the most extreme forms of repression, including imprisonment, forced exile, murder, and disappearance of thousands of political opponents. Linking several country intelligence agencies, they established an information and operational coordination known as Operación Cóndor. The information exchange between military governments, and between these and the CIA, led to hundreds of kidnappings, murders, and disappearances across the Southern Cone countries.

Seventy-one adults and children died, including one stillbirth. All victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster who died at the scene underwent post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) imaging using a mortuary-sited mobile computed tomography scanner. For the first time, to the authors? knowledge, the disaster victim identification (DVI) radiology reporting was undertaken remote to the mortuary scanning. Over an 11-week period, 119 scans were undertaken on 16 days, with up to 18 scans a day. These were delivered to a remote reporting centre at Leicester on 13 days with between 2 and 20 scans arriving each day. Using a disaster-specific process pathway, a team of 4 reporters, with 3 support staff members, trialled a prototype INTERPOL DVI radiology reporting form and produced full radiology reports and supporting image datasets such that they were able to provide 96% of prototype DVI forms, 99% of image datasets and 86% of preliminary reports to the DVI teams in London within one working day of image receipt. This paper describes the first use of remote radiology reporting for DVI and exemplifies how remote PMCT reporting can be used to support a DVI process of this scale. © 2019, The Author(s).",Disaster victim identification; Forensic; Grenfell Tower; INTERPOL; Mass fatality; Post-mortem computed tomography; Remote radiology reporting,"Body Remains; Disaster Victims; Documentation; Fires; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; United Kingdom; body remains; computed tomography scanner; devices; diagnostic imaging; disaster victim; documentation; fire; forensic anthropology; human; procedures; United Kingdom; x-ray computed tomography",,,,,,,"Rutty G.N., Robinson C.E., BouHaidar R., Jeffery A.J., Morgan B., The role of mobile computed tomography in mass fatality incidents, J Forensic Sci, 52, pp. 1343-1349, (2007); Rutty G.N., Robinson C.E., Jeffery A.J., Morgan B., Mobile computed tomography for mass fatality investigations, Forensic Sci Med Pathol, 3, pp. 138-145, (2007); O'Donnell C., Iino M., Mansharan K., Leditscke J., Woodford N., Contribution of postmortem multidetector CT scanning to identification of the deceased in a mass disaster: experience gained from the 2009 Victorian bushfires, Forensic Sci Int, 205, pp. 15-28, (2011); Khoo L.S., Hasmi A.H., Abdul Ghani Aziz S.A., Ibrahim M.A., Mahomood M.S., MH17: the Malaysian experience, Malays J Pathol, 38, pp. 1-10, (2016); Ranson D., The loss of Malaysian Airways flight MH17: a forensic and humanitarian task, J Law Med, 22, pp. 745-750, (2015); Rutty GN Alminyah A., Calla A., Elliott D., Fowler D., Hofman P., Lino M., Makino Y., Moskala A., O'Donnell C., Sajantila A., Vallis J., Woodford N., Wozniak K., Disaster victim identification.

Excavation of mass graves in the Chemmani area of northern peninsula of the country took place in September 1999, after about 5 years of the incident. Six graves with 1 to 6 bodies in each were identified and excavated in accordance with archaeological methods modified to suit the requirements of forensic exhumations. The experience gathered from excavation of those sites revealed the importance of archaeological methods in mass grave exhumations. For the first time in our forensic history, services of archaeologists and soil experts were used in the Chemmani exhumation.

A number of unique challenges for forensic science, different from domestic investigations, arise in these contexts. The setting and situation of these investigations regularly force forensic scientists into practices not regularly encountered while working in a standard criminal justice system. These practices can entail activities not specific to a practitioner's particular field or necessarily be scientific in nature, but are still needed in order for the investigation to move forward. These activities can include (1) establishing the number of and who exactly is missing after mass violence and disaster, (2) the creation of working protocols to deal with the scale of the loss of life that often overwhelm domestic practices and institutions, (3) negotiating the form that the investigation will take with various stakeholders, (4) addressing cultural beliefs of the affected society regarding the dead and missing, and (5) working within prescribed economic, political, and time constraints, among others. Forensic scientific responses to these challenges have proven to be flexible, innovative, and continually evolving. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Complex cases; Disasters; Forensic science; Large-scale investigations; Missing persons; Political violence,Attitude to Death; Body Remains; Culture; Disasters; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Mass Casualty Incidents; Politics; Resource Allocation; Article; body remains; crime victim; criminal justice; criminal law; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; forensic anthropology; forensic identification; human; mass disaster; politics; priority journal; protocol compliance; socioeconomics; time factor; violence; attitude to death; body remains; disaster; ethnology; forensic science; mass disaster; organization and management; resource allocation,,,,,,,"ICRC, Missing People, DNA Analysis and Identification of Human Remains: A Guide to Best Practice in Armed Conflicts and Other Situations of Armed Violence, (2009); ICRC, Guiding Principles/Model Law on the Missing, Principles for Legislating the Situation of Persons Missing as a Result of Armed Conflict or Internal Violence: Measures to Prevent Persons from Going Missing and to Protect the Rights and Interests of the Missing and their Families, (2009); United Nations, DRC: Further Mass Graves and Killings Discovered in Kasais, Says Zeid, (2017); Doretti M., Fondebrider L., Science and human rights: truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation, a long way in third world countries, Archaeol.

White material, observed in several burials, was analyzed with Raman spectroscopy and powder XRD, and confirmed to be lime. Archaeological findings at La Carcavilla's cemetery show that the application of lime was used in an organized way, mostly associated with coffinless interments of victims of Francoist repression. In burials with a lime cast, observations made it possible to draw conclusions regarding the presence of soft tissue at the moment of deposition, the sequence of events, and the presence of clothing and other evidence. This study illustrates the importance of analyzing a burial within the depositional environment and taphonomic context. © 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences",forensic archaeology; forensic science; identification; lime; mass grave; Raman spectroscopy; Spanish Civil War,"Burial; Calcium Compounds; Cemeteries; Forensic Anthropology; History, 20th Century; Humans; Oxides; Spain; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Warfare; calcium derivative; calcium oxide; oxide; burial; case report; cemetery; forensic anthropology; history; human; Raman spectrometry; Spain; warfare",,"calcium oxide, 1305-78-8; oxide, 16833-27-5; Calcium Compounds, ; lime, ; Oxides, ",,,,,"Schotsmans E.M.J., Van de Vijver K., Wilson A.S., Castex D., Interpreting lime burials.

In modern times, forensic anthropologists have helped to reconstruct the nature and mechanism, intent and purpose, manner, and circumstances of various inhumane instances of genocides and violent crimes. Anthropologists endeavor to bring closure and comfort to bereaved families by disseminating information about the location, exhumation, and identification of the remains of victims. The methodological armamentarium and scope of forensic anthropology have developed much beyond the realms of the traditional biological profiling casework to the scenarios of humanitarian concerns. Humanitarian forensics focuses on the excavation and identification of the remains of victims and facilitates the dignified burial of the deceased. This review article highlights and exemplifies the significant contributions of forensic anthropological expertise in revealing various crimes against humanity and human rights violations committed in the recent past as well as in some contemporary cases reported from around the globe. It includes cases such as Guatemalan, Cambodian, and Bosnian genocides, as well as other mass killings that illustrate the efficacy of anthropological evidence in reconstructing the nature, mechanism, and circumstances related to these incidences. Special emphasis is given to the Ajnala (India) skeletal remains excavated from an abandoned well - remains reportedly belonging to 282 Indian soldiers killed in 1857 whose corpses were dumped into the said disused well by sanitary workers - indicating the importance of forensic anthropology in authenticating the occurrence of events as mentioned in historical records. Analysis of different case histories reveals that forensic anthropologists have played a significant role in recovery and identification of the victims of the many war crimes, genocides, racial conflicts, and violent cruelties committed against mankind in modern history. © 2021, National Central Police University.

Case presentation: One such incident of mass killing of 282 Indian-origin soldiers by the colonial rulers in 1857 was reported from Ajnala (India) in early 2014. The damaged cranial fragments belonging to two individuals were retrieved from the vicinity of Ajnala mass-burial site later in 2014. In present study, the retrieved cranial elements were examined forensic anthropologically to assess whether their affinity is akin to the slain Ajnala sepoys or to the deceased who were buried prior to or later than it. The morphological and molecular analyses of these remains affirmed their affiliation to the mutiny sepoys of 1857 killed at Ajnala. Conclusions: The forensic anthropological and molecular examinations of cranial fragments found that these remains belonged to the individuals killed in the Ajnala incident. The multidisciplinary approach applied for identification of the badly damaged, fragmented, and commingled human remains helped in their presumptive identification. © 2023, International Association of Law and Forensic Sciences.",Ajnala; Case study; Forensic anthropology; Fragmented cranial elements; Unknown human remains,,,,,,"Birbal Sahni Institute; Chandigarh University, CU; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (SERB/F/4790/2018?2019); Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","Funding text 1: The first author (JSS) is highly thankful to Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India for providing financial support for this work in the form of Core Research Project (Animal Sciences), Grant no.

This is a case study of aero-disaster carried out by the authors at Port Harcourt International Airport on 10th December 2005. Information was adequately disseminated through different media to alert the public to come for the identification of the bodies. The 106 victims were then separated into those whose bodies were intact with few areas of burns, crushed/multiple fractures, those with severe burns, and dismembered or disintegrated bodies. Problems of identification was noticed in 26 (24.5%) of the victims which form the basis for this study. Those disputed by more than one family n = 11 (42.3%), those without dispute but very difficult to identify n = 6 (23.1%) and those that could not be identified n = 9 (34.6%). The cause of the identification difficulty also ranged from total disintegration of the bodies n = 9 (34.6%), severely burnt bodies n = 12 (46.2%) to those crushed with multiple fractures n = 5 (19.2%). Problems of identification of severely injured victims of aero-disaster in a limited facility setting can be minimized if strict and well documented pre-travel biometric profiles are taken. Facility for DNA fingerprint, forensic odontologists and forensic anthropologist should be provided. There should also be institution of aviation accident investigation team (AAIT) and mass disaster planning team (MDPT) to aid the identification of victims and probe into the cause and effect of the accident.",,"Accidents, Aviation; Disaster Planning; DNA Fingerprinting; Family; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Dentistry; Humans; Mass Casualty Incidents; Nigeria; aircraft accident; article; dentistry; disaster planning; DNA fingerprinting; family; human; mass disaster; Nigeria; organization and management; physical anthropology",,,,,,,,D.

The most recent official numbers given by the National Center for Historical Memory (Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica [CNMH]) provides an approximate number of 60,630 missing persons from 1970 to 2015. During this time, participants in the armed conflict performed different types of violence to one another, including torturing, disapperances, and multiple incidents of combat between militant groups and the Colombian National Army. Formerly, the agencies tasked with investigating these crimes were focused primarily on the cause and manner of death; identification was not the main purpose, leaving hundreds of unidentified victims buried in different cemeteries around the Colombian territory. The aim of this article is to provide a broad perspective of the dimension of the missing persons in Colombia, highlighting the achievements that have been made so far, presenting an example from the unidentified victims buried and recovered from ?La Resurrección? cemetery in Granada (Colombia) and analyzed by a specialized forensic team of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses [INMLyCF]) in the Eastern Region of Colombia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Armed Conflict; Colombia; Forensic Anthropology; Human Identification; Skeletal Remains,"Adult; Armed Conflicts; Body Remains; Bone and Bones; Colombia; Exhumation; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Male; Young Adult; achievement; adult; article; body remains; cemetery; Colombia; crime; female; forensic anthropology; forensic medicine; human; major clinical study; male; victim; war; bone; Colombia; exhumation; fracture; pathology; war; young adult",,,,,,,"(2011); Leal F., La doctrina de seguridad nacional: materialización de la Guerra Fría en América del Sur, Revista de estudios sociales., 15, pp. 74-87, (2003); Centro Nacional de Memoria Historica [CNMH], Hasta encontrarlos.

The disaster left almost 9000 individuals dead. The search and recovery as well as the subsequent Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) operations left much to be desired. The entire DVI operations consisted of examination of 365 bodies and collection of 15 blood/hair samples and 60 bone/tooth samples. This resulted in the scientific identification of eight individuals and visual recognition of 357. The scientific basis of identification of more than 8000 individuals, remains a question. The Disaster Response was hampered by miscommunication, incoordination and mismanagement on the part of all stakeholders and could have led to misidentification as well as missed identification. This demonstrates the importance of systematic management of dead bodies in mass casualty events to ensure dignity and respect of the deceased as well as family members. The helplessness felt by technical experts was compounded by the general lack of political will and the pressure on the law enforcement for quick disposal, irrespective of the available standards and protocols. Therefore, DVI operations can only be assumed to be a disaster in the making, when faced with lack of political will, lack of strict adherence to international standards as well as lack of determination from all stakeholders. Such a response from authorities is usually driven by panic following mass fatalities especially in disasters of great magnitude, like this one. The article discusses the challenges faced by the technical experts in the field and describes the advancements as well as recommendations for further improving the DVI operations in a resource-stricken country. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Disaster victim identification; Forensic anthropology; Forensic medicine; Nepal earthquake,Disaster Victims; Disasters; Earthquakes; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Mass Casualty Incidents; Nepal; Rescue Work; Article; blood sampling; bone; disaster victim; earthquake; forensic anthropology; forensic identification; hair analysis; helplessness; human; law enforcement; mass disaster; medicolegal aspect; Nepal; politics; priority journal; tooth; trend study; disaster; disaster victim; forensic medicine; mass disaster; organization and management; rescue work,,,,,"Panjab University, Chandigarh; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, ??????; University Grants Committee, UGC","The authors would like to acknowledge and thank all those involved in the DVI operations at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Maharajgunj Medical Campus, Institute of Medicine, Kathmandu, Nepal.

Such scenes pose four conceptual challenges to investigators and forensic experts: the individual victim, the crime, the setting, and the statistical. Exhumation and post-mortem examination of mortal remains with associated personal and forensic evidence require integrated management of core forensic personnel including investigators, archaeologists, anthropologists, odontologists and pathologists, among whom there is overlapping expertise. The key to avoiding competition and ill-will among experts is to recognize that all such experts should be enabled to make known how their expertise matches with the temporal and spatial boundaries of victim, crime and setting. In turn, they should be apprised of where they fit into the overall judicial process and their limits within the investigation. Consequently, each expert requires access to the factual background of the case, to the site and its contents throughout the investigation. Each forensic team member has a responsibility to influence the investigation - throughout its course when possible - to make findings within their areas of expertise, and to make these available to the rest of the team so as to contribute most meaningfully to the aims of the investigation, both forensic and humanitarian. The on-site crime scene manager has an overarching role to enable integrated access to the complete scene and its contents by each forensic expert team member. In other words, the forensic scientist is given access and the ability to influence the investigation while control of evidence from the site as to identity and criminal activity are maintained by the crime scene manager. This contribution is directed at both the crime scene manager and each forensic expert; it describes the essential spatial and temporal parameters of an expert's opinion so as to encourage cooperation, and discourage conflict, within the forensic team. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study examines the success of disaster victim identification (DVI) in military aviation accident fatalities in the Australian Defense Force (ADF). Methods: Accident reports and autopsy records of aircrew fatalities during the period 1945-2002 were examined to identify difficulties experienced during the DVI process or injuries that would prevent identification of remains using non-DNA methods. Results: The ADF had 301 aircraft fatalities sustained in 144 accidents during the period 1945-2002. The autopsy reports for 117 fatalities were reviewed (covering 73.7% of aircrew fatalities from 1960-2002). Of the 117 victims, 38 (32.4%) sustained injuries which were severe enough to prevent identification by traditional (non-DNA) comparative scientific DVI techniques of fingerprint and dental analysis. Conclusions: Many of the ADF fatalities who could not be positively identified in the past could be identified today through the use of DNA techniques. Successful DNA identification, however, depends on having a reference DNA profile. This paper recommends the establishment of a DNA repository to store reference blood samples to facilitate the identification of ADF aircrew remains without causing additional distress to family members.",Aircraft accident; Aviation pathology; DNA,"Accidents, Aviation; Aerospace Medicine; Australia; Databases, Factual; Disasters; DNA; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Dentistry; Humans; Military Personnel; adult; aircraft accident; army; article; aviation; death certificate; disaster; DNA determination; fatality; female; forensic identification; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; terrorism; victim",,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,,"Ballantyne J., Mass disaster genetics, Nature Genet, 15, pp. 329-331, (1997); Brannon R.B., Morlang W.M., Tenerife revisited: The critical role of dentistry, J Forensic Sci, 46, pp. 722-725, (2001); Canfield D., Hansrote R., Reducing post aviation accident trauma, Federal Aviation Administration (US) Federal Air Surgeon's Medical Bulletin, 99, 1; Clayton T.M., Whitaker J.P., Maguire C.N., Identification of bodies from the scene of a mass disaster using DNA amplification of short tandem repeat (STR) loci, Forensic Sci Int, 76, pp. 7-15, (1995); Cullen S.A., Accident investigation, Aviation Medicine. 3rd Ed., (1999); Fernando R., Vanezis P., Medicolegal aspects of the Thai Airbus crash near Kathmandu, Nepal: Findings of the investigating pathologists, Am J Forensic Med Pathol, 19, pp. 169-173, (1998); Heras S., Valenzuela A., Villanueva E., Et al., Methods for identification of 28 burn victims following a 1996 bus accident in Spain, J Forensic Sci, 44, pp. 428-431, (1999); Hill I., Dental identification in fatal aircraft accidents, Aviat Space Environ Med, 51, pp. 1021-1025, (1980); Hsu C., Huang N., Tsai L., Et al., Identification of victims of the 1998 Taoyuan Airbus crash accident using DNA analysis, Int J Legal Med, 113, pp. 43-46, (1999); Hutt J.M., Ludes B., Kaess B., Tracqui A., Odontological identification of the victims of Flight AI.IT 5148 air disaster, Lyon-Strasbourg 20.01.1992, Int J Legal Med, 107, pp. 275-279, (1995); Lash C., Flight 93 victim identification long, arduous, Post-Gazette, (2001); Leapley F., Fingerprint identification and the disaster victim, Aviat Space Environ Med, 51, pp. 1015-1018, (1980); Ludes B., Tracqui A., Pfitzinger H., Et al., Medico-legal investigations of the Airbus A320 crash upon Mount Ste-Odile, France, J Forensic Sci, 39, pp. 1147-1152, (1994); Moody G.H., Busutti A., Identification in the Lockerbie air disaster, Am J Forensic Med Pathol, 15, pp. 63-69, (1994); Nambiar P., Jalil N., Sing B., The dental identification of an aircraft accident in Malaysia, Int Dent J, 47, pp. 9-15, (1997); Olaisen B., Stenersen M., Mevag B., Identification by DNA analysis of the August 1996 Spitsbergen civil aircraft disaster, Nature Genetics, 15, pp. 402-405, (1997); Robb N., 229 People, 15,000 body parts: Pathologists help solve Swissair 111's grisly puzzles, CMAJ, 160, pp. 241-243, (1999); Robles F., Details, DNA key in victim identification, Houston Chronicle, (2001); Weedn V., Postmortem identification of remains, Clin Lab Med, 18, pp. 115-134, (1998); Wolcott J., Menzies R., Donahue E., Hoffa N., Use of personal effects in the Canary Island accident investigation, Aviat Space Environ Med, 51, pp. 1019-1020, (1980); Wolcott J.H., Hanson C.A., Summary of the means used to positively identify the American victims in the Canary Islands crash, Aviat Space Environ Med, 51, pp. 1034-1035, (1980)",email: Adrian.Smith1@defence.gov.au,,,,,,,,956562,,ASEMC,14620478,English,Aviat.

This paper presents the results of a scientific investigation of a reported massacre at Sturt Creek where burnt bone fragments were identified in two adjacent sites and documents the archaeological signatures associated with the sites. The methodology used to undertake the project brought together three systems of knowledge: the oral testimonies of the descent group originating from a sole adult survivor of the massacre; archival, historical and scientific research. An archaeological survey defined the two distinct sites containing hundreds of fragile bone fragments; a third site was found to be highly disturbed. Scientific investigations included macroscopic and microscopic examination of selected bone fragments by an anatomical pathologist and a zooarchaeologist and X-ray diffraction analysis of sixteen bone fragments. The anatomical pathologist and zooarchaeologist undertook macroscopic and microscopic examinations of selected bone samples to identify morphological evidence for human origin. It was concluded that three bone fragments examined may have been human, and two of the fragments may have been from the vault of a skull. It was concluded that the likelihood of them being human would be strengthened if it was found that the three samples had been subjected to high temperatures. X-ray diffraction analysis of 16 bone fragments provided this evidence. All fragments showed sharp hydroxylapatite peaks (crystallite sizes 9882 nm and 597 nm respectively) and all had been subjected to extreme temperatures of either 600 °C for more than 80 h, 650 °C for more than 20 h, 700 °C for more than 4 h or 800 °C for more than 1 h. XRD analyses were also done on bone samples collected from three cooking hearths at three different archaeological sites. It was found that two of the three samples had been exposed to substantially lower temperatures for a short time period. It was concluded that there was strong pathological and archaeological evidence that the bone fragments were human in origin, but that the evidence was not conclusive. This research also identified archaeological signatures for the identification of massacre sites in similar Australian environments and circumstances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Australian Aboriginal massacres; Kimberley frontier; Massacre archaeology; Sturt Creek massacre; XRD burnt bone,Archaeology; Australia; Bone and Bones; Burns; Crime Victims; Durapatite; Fires; Forensic Anthropology; Homicide; Humans; Microscopy; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Police; X-Ray Diffraction; hydroxyapatite; hydroxyapatite; archeology; Article; Australia; Australian Aborigine; bone tissue; crime; crystal structure; forensic identification; high temperature; human; human tissue; incineration; low temperature; medical research; methodology; microscopy; pathologist; priority journal; survivor; violence; X ray diffraction; bone; burn; chemistry; crime victim; fire; forensic anthropology; homicide; Oceanic ancestry group; pathology; police,,"hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8; Durapatite, ",,,"Kimberley Land Council, Broome, Western Australia; Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, AIATSIS","Funding for this project was awarded to the Kimberley Land Council, Broome, Western Australia in 2009 by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Studies, Canberra .

A few ""multiple burial"" graves were examined, but no mass graves were encountered. The main purpose of the autopsies was to establish the cause and manner of death. Identification was of less importance, but a majority of the bodies had been identified prior to the autopsy. A total of 308 bodies, mainly males, were examined.

Yet despite the sudden chaos they wreak and their prevalence during the last decade or so, most societies have only recently created organizational forms that can manage and handle their threatening potential. This article analyzes the relations between terror attacks and the emergence of new organizations specializing in death and disaster. We explore this issue through the case of ZAKA, the Ultra-Orthodox Identification Teams for Victims of Disasters in Israel. This organization sheds light on how in highly complex and bureaucratized countries new types of specialists in death by terror developed. From an anthropological point of view, organizational specialists in death by terror are expected to act proficiently on the basis of existing cultural norms and principles. Such organizational bodies are not only expressions of social responses to the unexpected disorder produced by terror but are also powerful cultural agents that produce new meanings. Concretely, not all organizations gain trust and support from the general public to allow its members to touch, treat and recompose the bodies of the dead, we contend that ZAKA legitimizes its goals and actions through the amalgamation of three unique elements: (a) Given that ZAKA's practices are grounded in Jewish traditions concerning death and burial, the organization use these cultural roots to gain acceptance of treating victims of terror attacks. In this way, the actions of ZAKA volunteers are legitimized since they fulfill central religious (Talmudic) duties concerning death and the treatment of corpses, (b) The organization mixes practices and knowledge from different institutions and bodies such as the police, military or medical organizations. Moreover, ZAKA cooperates with various state organizations that specialize in death events and disasters. This combination not only reinforces the legitimacy of their actions but turns them into social experts for dealing with the victims of terror and mass death. (c) During a terror event the organization deals not only with death but also with aid to, and treatment of, the injured. By giving them social permission to treat, touch and recompose the human flesh, society also sanctions them to touch the very basis of social order: treating the human body and dealing with questions of life and death in the public sphere. We end by offering a number of thoughts about the wider implications of our case study.",Haredi; Israel; Religion; Terror; Terrorism; Violence; ZAKA,,,,,,,,"Abramovitch H., Good death and bad death, Traumatic and Nontraumatic Loss and Bereavement, (1999);

It requires a great deal of caution and critical judgment to analyze the nature of injuries, especially those resulting from an explosion. Scientific publications in the field of traumatology concerning injuries caused by the action of explosives mainly focus on the effects of contemporary terrorist or military activities. The results of this research regard mainly clinical medicine and the organization of healthcare. This article discusses the problems and solutions of determining the presence of injuries caused by explosions on badly decomposed human remains exhumed 70 years after death. To obtain optimal results in valuable injures estimation it is vital to apply efficient work methods i.e.: forensic team composed of experienced pathologist and anthropologist, archeological methodology and doubled examination and description of the remains (in the field and next in the autopsy room), detailed photographical documentation and protocol. The results of forensic examinations of the remains (58 fragments forming anatomical wholes), derived from not fewer than 30 individuals (MNI = 30), confirmed, despite the presence of severe taphonomic changes, the presence of injuries caused by an explosion. Forensic examination of the remains revealed a characteristic pattern of injuries resulting from the dismembering the bodies. We discovered typical traumatic amputation of the limbs, which corresponds to the aforementioned mechanism of injury. The findings confirm the thesis that in the area of the former Luftwaffe airport near Stary Grodków (Opole province, Poland), in September 1946, a group of Polish postwar partisans was liquidated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Blast injury; Crime scene; Excavation; Exhumation; Explosion; Gunshot injuries; Polish anticommunist resistance; Traumatic amputation,Armed Conflicts; Blast Injuries; Explosions; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Male; Poland; Time Factors; anatomy; anthropology; archeology; army; Article; autolysis; autopsy; blast injury; body remains; exhumation; explosion; forensic pathology; human; human tissue; limb; medical documentation; medical photography; pathologist; Poland; taphonomy; traumatic amputation; war; blast injury; forensic medicine; male; pathology; time factor,,,,,"Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej, MON","We wish to thank the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Poland for their help, as well as, above all, the elite group of sappers from the 1st ?Tadeusz Kosciuszko?

In 1948 and 1949, prisoners sentenced to death by firing squad - most of them associated with the post-war anti-communist underground independence movement in Poland - were buried there. The aim of the study was to analyse fatal wounds and the method of execution, and to compare the results to data from archival documents. The results were also compared with studies concerning executions during a later period, i.e. 1949-1954. The research on the method of execution during this period of history carried out during the exhumations in Osobowicki Cemetery was the first conducted on such a scale in Poland. Forensic analysis revealed a wide variety of gunshot wounds inflicted during executions, revealing both gunshots to the head, especially single shots to the back of the head, and cases corresponding to the use of a firing squad, probably equipped with machine guns.

Nearly half these casualties were accounted for after the battle. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has worked to identify the remaining ~510 unaccounted-for service members and has successfully identified ~160 service members to date. Demographic data pulled from historical documentation of the US losses indicate a relatively homogeneous population (99% White, 81% 17-23 years of age, and only two individuals with a documented religious preference other than Protestant or Catholic). Using this demographic data as a framework, three case studies are presented to demonstrate how a holistic biosocial approach to building identity could facilitate forensic identifications. The temporal and sociocultural contextualization of analyses enables anthropologists to navigate inconsistencies between 21st-century and historical (1940s) social identity concepts to overcome challenges to identification. The case studies demonstrate how biological evidence, genetic evidence, and material evidence (material culture) differently contribute to the social identity of an individual and can impact identification efforts when analytical conclusions are incongruent with historical documentation. The first case of US Battle of Tarawa casualties examines how morphometric biological affinity assessments are biased by the fluidity of social identity concepts when complex morphological and metric indicators of biological affinity are not represented in historical race categories. The second case demonstrates how biogeographic genetic affinity predictions, through a discussion of the G2a4 haplogroup, need to be examined holistically in the context of other lines of evidence. The third case highlights how material evidence can further define social identity beyond physicality, genetic structure, and race. The challenges of interpreting identity from human remains, as highlighted through these examples, are commonly encountered by anthropologists working in disaster victim identification and other humanitarian contexts. Thus, it is imperative for anthropologists to be self-aware of implicit biases toward the current prevailing definitions of biological and social identity and to consider historical perceptions of identity when working in these contexts.",BATTLE OF TARAWA; BIOGEOGRAPHIC AFFINITY; BIOSOCIAL IDENTITY; FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY; FORENSIC IDENTIFICATION,"Bias, Implicit; Disaster Victims; Documentation; Ethnicity; Humans; World War II; case report; disaster victim; documentation; ethnicity; human; implicit bias; war",,,,,,,,,,NLM (Medline),,,,,,15346617,,,37733461,English,Hum Biol,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171953483

Casualties were buried in isolated and mass graves, which were negatively affected by the wartime renovations of the island, resulting in only ~47% of the remains being recovered in the late 1940s. The nature of the wartime burials, multiple postwar disinterments and reinterments, identification efforts in the late 1940s, and postwar anthropogenic changes to the island by the local population have contributed to the commingling of casualties. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency established the Tarawa Project in 2016 to assist in the sorting, association, and identification of the often commingled remains recovered directly from the Republic of Kiribati and 94 caskets of Battle of Tarawa unknowns disinterred from the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Honolulu, Hawai?i. The project has been able to confirm a minimum number of individuals (MNI) of 243 based on unique mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences, while inventory of ~9,000 elements indicates a MNI of 131 from disinterments and 96 from recent field recoveries. The Tarawa Project has used a combination of historical research, DNA testing, chest radiograph and odontological comparisons, and forensic anthropological and material evidence analyses to help identify 41 of the 84 total service members accounted for from the Battle of Tarawa since the 1940s. © 2019 University of Florida Press.",commingling; forensic anthropology; Tarawa,,,,,,"U.S. Department of Defense, DOD","We would like to acknowledge all of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice; DPAA?s strategic partner, History Flight, Inc., for their recovery efforts on Betio Island; and our project team and colleagues for feedback on this paper.

As a result, Polish territory has been the site of hostilities, totalitarian terror, and acts of genocide. Following the end of World War II, Poland became part of the so-called Eastern Bloc. A movement known as the anti-communist underground arose within Polish territory with the aim of conducting partisan warfare and political and propaganda activities against the occupiers. Partisans were victims of campaigns of liquidation; they lost their lives during interrogations, died in prisons, were sentenced to death by Polish courts, and were subsequently buried at unknown sites throughout the country. In connection with war and post-war events within Polish territory, the remains of victims of both World War II and post-war political repressions are being found to this day. In addition, remains derived from historical populations are being discovered as well as present-day remains belonging to missing persons or victims of criminal offences. A portion of the remains resulting from military operations and the post-war history of Poland are discovered by chance, but discovery of the burial sites of victims of communist crimes is often preceded by many years of research. International agreements and Polish legal regulations make it possible to search for victims of armed conflicts of various nationalities within the country. The process of identifying victims of armed conflicts, political terror and genocide can be carried out thanks to routine procedures for handling unidentified remains. Given the diversity (various historical periods, various nationalities) of the discovered remains, the elaborated procedures enable their dignified burial. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Communist terror; Exhumation; Identification human remains; Poland; WW II victims,"Algorithms; Body Remains; Exhumation; Forensic Anthropology; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Personnel; Poland; Warfare; World War II; adult; burial; court; crime; exhumation; genocide; hostility; human; Poland; prison; propaganda; review; victim; warfare; algorithm; body remains; forensic anthropology; history; legislation and jurisprudence; military personnel; organization and management; Poland; war",,,,,,,"Dziurak A., Galezowski M., Kaminski L., Musial F., From Independence to Independence.

I consider two connected issues. The first regards bereavement journeys of victims? families and the significance of receiving a body to bury vis-à-vis the normative assignment to find closure. The second issue I address is how forensic experts, their technologies, and managing protocols interact with victims? families and their emotions. Using insights from Science and Technology Studies, I articulate some of the goods and bads of identification practices and argue for extensive communication and cooperation between experts and victims? families. © 2018 Victor Toom.

The development of research in biological and forensic anthropology has made rapid progress worldwide in the past few years, however, in most countries - with the exception of the United States - forensic anthropology work is still considered within the duties of the forensic pathologist. This paper attempts to summarise the history and development of forensic anthropology in Thailand by providing information on past and current research and practice that can help forensic practitioners to apply existing methods in forensic cases and mass disasters. It is hoped that the lessons learned from the tsunami catastrophe and the emerging need for positive identification in medicolegal settings will lead to rapid advances in education, training and professional engagement of anthropologists from the forensic departments and the law enforcement agencies in Thailand. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Biological profiling; Forensic anthropology; Forensic anthropology population data; Positive identification; Thailand,"Forecasting; Forensic Anthropology; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Professional Role; Research; Thailand; accuracy; age determination; Article; bone structure; DNA determination; female; forensic identification; growth curve; history; human; male; medical practice; medical research; osteometry; physical anthropology; population research; priority journal; puberty; sex determination; sexual maturation; Thailand; forecasting; forensic anthropology; history; organization and management; professional standard; research; trends",,,,,"Central Institute of Forensic Science; Central Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Justice; Chief of Missing Person Identification Centre; TBFM","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Pol.

These anthropological initiatives can be traced back to the Smithsonian seminar organized by T. D. Stewart in 1968 and published in 1970. Key developments include the 1984 delegation sent by the American Association for the Advancement of Science to Argentina and the formation of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team. Subsequent highlights include major anthropological involvement in support of investigations by international criminal tribunals, formation of forensic anthropology teams in different countries and activities of the International Commission of Missing Persons and the forensic unit of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Recent developments feature the formation of the Humanitarian and Human Rights Resource Center of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and its support of worthwhile projects in many countries. The published record provides historical perspective on these developments. © 2018",Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Human rights; Humanitarian action,"Academies and Institutes; Body Remains; Disaster Victims; Disasters; Forensic Anthropology; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Human Rights Abuses; Humans; International Agencies; Mass Casualty Incidents; Organizations, Nonprofit; Publications; Societies; adult; Argentina; article; forensic anthropology; human; human rights abuse; offender; red cross; body remains; disaster; disaster victim; forensic anthropology; history; international cooperation; mass disaster; non profit organization; organization; publication",,,,,"National Institute of Justice, NIJ; American Academy of Forensic Sciences, AAFS","New organizational support for humanitarian and human rights forensic involvement marks an additional sign of maturity in this area of forensic anthropology. Organizations such as the AAAS, AAFS and the American Association of Physical Anthropologists (AAPA) have maintained interest in such initiatives and provided opportunities for scholarly presentations and interaction through their annual meetings. In 2015, AAFS expanded that interest in creating a formal program ?The Humanitarian and Human Rights Resource Center? (HHRRC) [ 82 ]. This new program seeks to utilize assets of AAFS to promote quality applications of forensic science to global problems and issues in need of assistance. The HHRRC provides resources and support to AAFS members and others and encourages professional involvement in relevant international issues. Subcommittees develop resources relating to publications, documents, laboratory protocols, educational materials and equipment. The program also features monetary support for needy projects judged by an international advisory group and committee chairs. The AAFS and the Forensic Technology Center of Excellence (FTCOE) program of the National Institute of Justice (USA) provide funding for this initiative [ 82 ].

It is based on data from five secondary mass grave sites of different sizes and different numbers of unassociated body parts. The study is centered on a comparison of MNI estimation from original excavations with the actual number of individuals buried in particular graves, obtained via DNA identification of excavated remains. The aim was to investigate how the complexity of a mass grave reflects on MNI estimation accuracy. In order to quantify mass grave complexity (level of commingling), a ratio between complete bodies and isolated body parts from the same context was introduced. Results show that, in the secondary mass graves involved in the study, MNI estimation inaccuracy varies in the range from 54% to 513% depending on the size of the grave itself and the amount of ?loose elements? distributed in it. Correlation between MNI inaccuracy and body to body parts ratio shows a strong relationship indicating that MNI (in)accuracy is largely dependent on the number of loose elements related to complete bodies from the same context. © 2019, Springer Science???

The study is based on data from 10 commingled secondary mass grave sites and two primary sites related to the war in Bosnia in 1995. The aim was to investigate differences in level of body fragmentation between mass graves of similar origin and taphonomy. In order to quantify the degree of fragmentation (and level of commingling) within a grave, we introduced a fragmentation index (FI). FI represents the ratio between the number of complete bodies and number of body parts from the same context. Results show high discrepancies in body fragmentations between different sites. FI for secondary sites of similar formation history varied from 0.01 to 0.59 (max = 1), while two primary sites have values 0.92 and 0.90 respectively. Variable levels of fragmentation among similar secondary sites suggest a possibility of different peri mortem circumstances of buried, so we tested whether the ?body fragmentation index? could assist in elucidating the manner of death. Unusually high levels of body fragmentation (FI value below 0.1) in some secondary sites may indicate that body disarticulation was most likely caused peri-mortem by explosives, land mines, mortars or tank fire, all suggesting a combat situation. © 2020",Commingled human remains; Forensic anthropology; Forensic archeology; Forensic science; Fragmentation index; Secondary mass graves,Body Remains; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Burial; Exhumation; Forensic Anthropology; Forensic Ballistics; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Warfare; anthropometric parameters; Article; autopsy; battle injury; body fragmentation index; body regions; body remains; Bosnia and Herzegovina; burial; case study; cemetery; death; disarticulation; explosion; fire and fire related phenomena; forensic anthropology; forensic science; histogram; human; mass disaster; mining; tank fire; taphonomy; war; ballistics; exhumation; pathology; procedures; warfare,,,,,"Ministarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnolo?kog Razvoja, MPNTR, (III 45005)",This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia ; Grant number: III 45005 .,"Jessee E., Skinner M., A typology of mass grave and mass grave-related sites, Forensic Sci.

The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability of this widely used method and to compare it to various dental and other skeletal age assessment methods. Forty-seven Finnish children of known ages below 16 years, who perished in Thailand in the Southeast Asian Tsunami on 26 December 2004 were examined. Every victim repatriated to Finland underwent a complete forensic autopsy including CT-scan, toxicological screening, and diatom analysis in order to establish the cause of death, as well as DNA testing and dental examination for the verification of the identification established in Thailand. Age assessment was performed by dental and skeletal methods. The average difference between the age assessment values obtained by the Greulich and Pyle method, and the chronological age was 9.7 months. In addition to the Greulich and Pyle method, an alternate skeletal method, Tanner and Whitehouse 2, resulted in an average age difference of 10.3 months. Dental age assessment methods were based either on the eruption (Nyström method, 8 cases, average age difference 5.6 months), or the development of the crown and roots (Demirjian method, 33 cases, average age difference 5.2 months and ABFO method, 7 cases, average differences 12. 6 months). Dental methods proved to be most accurate in childhood until the teeth-with the exception of wisdom teeth-have erupted and root development is completed. In adolescence, however, the validity of skeletal methods improves considerably. © 2011 Springer Science???

The main ethical consideration that emerged was tracing the missing and identifying the dead are crucial to maintaining or restoring basic human rights and responsible relief activities. Identification is not only an organizational and scientific achievement but, regardless of circumstances, also necessarily and always an activity with significant political, epistemic, and philosophical relevance and consequence. In India, it could be important to consider new legal provisions for the management of human samples so that this would provide a starting point for the treatment of human remains managed for forensic purposes with uniformity in the country. Another important step in which governments should take part regards the involvement and education of the general public to develop their interest in this important goal. In the field of forensic anthropology, artificial intelligence can support, through the use of algorithms, the decision-making process that leads to the identification of the victim or its remains. Furthermore, they can be used to extract new knowledge from huge databases and shorten identification through computer automation of data binding activities. Applying artificial intelligence tools in forensic sciences to collect new information from massive datasets to enhance knowledge, and reduce human subjectivity and errors, provides a greater scientific basis that could improve the strength of the evidence and support the admissibility of expert evidence. In light of the general lack of national/international guidance about ethical oversight for identification and care of human remains, the fact that regulations are frequently not adequate to govern ethical aspects, we hope that an internationally recognized body should develop such guidance in collaboration with relevant organizations. © The Author(s) 2023.

The first forensic trace evidence was collected after the human remains were transferred to a safe location in the Netherlands for identification and repatriation. Disaster victim identification processes were therefore undertaken in concert with the forensic investigation. Prior to these processes, X-ray and computed tomography scanners were used to reveal foreign objects in the human remains, and a large number of these fragments were recovered after the forensic triage. A distinct group of metal fragments was identified as being potential remnants of high-energy foreign objects. Forensic analysis revealed that they were explosively deformed unalloyed steel fragments, some of which had shapes consistent with pre-formed metal fragments found in a 9N314M warhead used in Buk SA-11 missiles. Furthermore, thin film deposits of cockpit glass and aluminium were identified on the most heavily deformed side of some of the explosively deformed metal fragments, suggesting they came from outside the airplane. These findings supported early suspicions that Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was struck by a Buk SA-11 missile.

New York City's Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) was given the task of systematically searching the site for any remaining victims' remains. The subsequent OCME assessment and archaeological excavation conducted from 2006 until 2013, resulted in the recovery of over 1,900 victims' remains. In addition, this operation demonstrated the essential skills archaeologists can provide in a mass disaster recovery operation. The OCME excavation data illustrates some of the challenges encountered during the original recovery effort of 2001/2002. It suggests that when understood within the larger site recovery context, certain fundamental components of the original recovery effort, such as operational priorities and activities in effect during the original recovery, directly or indirectly resulted in unsearched deposits that contained human remains. © 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",9/11; Forensic anthropology; Forensic archaeology; Forensic science; Mass disaster recovery; Mass fatality; Scene reconstruction; World Trade Center,Disasters; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; New York City; September 11 Terrorist Attacks; disaster; forensic anthropology; human; New York; terrorism,,,,,,,"Glanz J., Lipton E., City in the sky: the rise and fall of the World Trade Center, pp. 287-291, (2003); Gillespie A.K., Twin towers: the life of New York City's world trade center, (2001); World Trade Center building performance study: data collection, preliminary observations, and recommendations, (2002); Dwyer J., Flynn K., 102 minutes: the untold story of the fight to survive inside the twin towers, (2005); Mundorff A.Z., Human identification following the World Trade Center disaster: assessing management practices for highly fragmented and commingled human remains, (2009); Mundorff A.Z., Anthropologist-directed triage: three distinct mass fatality events involving fragmentation of human remains, Recovery, analysis and identification of commingled human remains, pp. 123-144, (2008); Langewiesche W., American ground: unbuilding the World Trade Center, (2002); Sledzik P.S., Dirkmaat D., Mann R.W., Holland T.D., Mundorff A.Z., Adams B., Et al., Disaster victim recovery and identification: forensic anthropology in the aftermath of September 11, Hard evidence: case studies in forensic anthropology, pp. 289-302, (2009); Cardwell D., Talk of ground zero tribute, as West Street reopens., New York Times, (2002); Lipton E., Glanz J., Last 4 firefighters leave ground zero: 'our work is done.', (2002); Brenner C.H., World Trade Center Disaster Identification diary, (2015); New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner World Trade Center operational statistics, (2003); New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner World Trade Center operational statistics, (2006); Dwyer J., Pieces of bone are found on building at 9/11 site, (2006); Gill J.R., Desire M., Dickerson T., Adams B.J., The 9/11 attacks: the medicolegal investigation of the World Trade Center fatalities, Forensic pathology review, pp. 181-195, (2011); Rainwater C.W., Crowder C., Hartnett K.M., Fridie J.S., Figura B.J., Godbold J., Et al., Forensic anthropology at the New York Medical Examiner, A companion to forensic anthropology, pp. 561-562, (2012); Warnasch S.C., Archaeological methodology and strategy used at the World Trade Center Site, (2010); Lowers H.A., Meeker G.P., Particle atlas of World Trade Center dust., United States Geological Survey Open-File Report No.: 2005-1165, (2012); Mendonca D., Peraza D.B., Stefan P., Innovation, risk and reward at Ground Zero, Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers: Structural Congress 2005: Metropolis and Beyond, (2005); Dirkmaat D., Documenting context at the outdoor crime scene: why bother?, A companion to forensic anthropology, pp. 48-63, (2012); Sledzik P., Forensic anthropology in disaster response, Handbook of forensic anthropology and archaeology.

Identification Lab., Hickam Airforce Base, HI, United States, Hickam Airforce Base, HI 96853, 310 Worchester Avenue, United States","The excavation of a 23 year-old aircraft crash site in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the transformational processes preceding its excavation in 1995-1996 are detailed. The history of the site involved an initial catastrophic event, with subsequent reclamation and disturbances. Ultimately, a recovery effort by a joint U.S. team from the Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii (CILHI), Joint Task Force-Full Accounting (JTF-FA) and a Socialist Republic of Vietnam contingent yielded numerous human remains, personal effects, and life-support items from the crash site. This case study should be of interest to the increasing number of forensic anthropologists who carry out work in international contexts. The application of forensic anthropology in human rights abuse cases, for example in Rwanda, Argentina and Bosnia, provide examples of such cross-cultural endeavors. Cultural factors act in the development of a site and should not be overlooked as significant taphonomic agents. The approach that an indigenous pearson takes to a crash site or mass grave may be quite different from our own approach, involving Western science. Holland, Anderson, and Mann (1) describe the postmortem alteration of exhumed and/or curated bone caused by indigenous Southeast Asian peoples; the examples provided by these authors demonstrate how culture affects the treatment of what we would call 'evidence.' The international nature of an incident can add complicating 'Trite' to the reconstruction of events, since reclamation responses by indigenous people vary according to their interpretations of the scene. An investigating forensic anthropologist needs to understand the emic viewpoint (the insider's view), as cultural anthropologists do, when attempting to recover and reconstruct such an incident. In response to the cultural (and natural) taphonomic agents at work on such a site, the use of dual forensic recovery methods-simultaneously treating the investigation scene like an aircraft crash and a clandestine burial site-is advised. Employing a flexible set of methods will allow for maximal recovery of evidence.",Dual methods; Emic viewpoint; Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Human remains recovery,aircraft accident; article; cadaver; cultural factor; human; physical anthropology; priority journal; Viet Nam,,,,,,,"Holland T., Anderson B., Mann R., Human variables in the postmortem alteration of human bone: Examples from U.S. war casualties, Forensic Taphonomy: The Postmortem Fate of Human Remains, pp. 263-274, (1997); Ludes B., Tracqui A., Pfitzinger H., Kintz P., Levy F., Disteldorf M., Et al., Medico-legal investigations of the airbus A320 crash upon Mount Ste-Odile, France, J Forensic Sci, 39, pp. 1147-1152, (1994); McCarty V.O., Sohn A.P., Ritzlin R.S., Gauthier J.H., Scene investigation, identification, and victim examination following the accident of Galaxy 203: Disaster preplanning does work, J Forensic Sci, 32, pp. 983-987, (1987); Stahl C.J., McMeekin R.R., Ruehle C.J., Canik J.J., The medical investigation of airship accidents, J Forensic Sci, 33, pp. 888-898, (1988); Stoutamire J., Excavation and recovery, Handbook of Forensic Archaeology and Anthropology, pp. 20-47, (1983); Fisher R.S., Aircraft crash investigation, Medicolegal Investigation of Death, pp. 406-419, (1980); Dimaio D.J., Dimaio V.J., Forensic Pathology, (1989); Owsley D.W., Techniques for locating burials with emphasis on the probe, J Forensic Sci, 40, pp. 735-740, (1995); Duncan J., Search techniques, Handbook of Forensic Archaeology and Anthropology, pp. 4-19, (1983); Thomas D.H., Archaeology Down to Earth, (1991); Swegennis R., Impact angles and velocities, Safety Investigation: Investigative Techniques, pp. 1-16, (1987); France D.L., Griffin T.J., Swanburg J.G., Lindemann J.W., Davenport G.C., Trammell V., Et al., A multidisciplinary approach to the detection of clandestine graves, J Forensic Sci, 37, pp. 1445-1458, (1992); Scott D.D., Connor M., Context delecti: Archaeological context in forensic work, Forensic Taphonomy: The Postmortem Fate of Human Remains, pp. 27-38, (1997)",,,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,,,,,,221198,,JFSCA,9544536,English,J.
